const weekdayPredictions: Record<string, { planet: string; prediction: string }> = {
  Sunday: {
    planet: 'Sun',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Sunday, the day ruled by the Sun (Surya), the king of the nine celestial bodies in Vedic astrology. The Sun represents the soul (Atma-karaka), authority, vitality, and the father principle. According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, those born on Sunday carry the radiance and commanding presence of the solar deity. You possess natural leadership abilities and a strong desire to be recognized for your accomplishments. Your personality radiates warmth and confidence, and you tend to gravitate toward positions of authority, government service, or administrative roles where your organizational talents can shine. People are naturally drawn to your dignified bearing and self-assurance.

Your constitution tends to be robust, with a strong bone structure and good overall vitality, as the Sun governs the skeletal system and heart in Vedic medical astrology. Phaladeepika notes that Sunday-born individuals are blessed with courage, a righteous disposition, and an inclination toward dharmic living. You have a keen sense of honor and may sometimes appear proud or dominating, but this stems from your innate conviction in doing what is right. Your relationship with your father is a significant theme in your life—either deeply influential and supportive or marked by lessons of independence and self-reliance.

In matters of career and wealth, you are likely to earn through government, politics, medicine, or any field where you can exercise authority and make independent decisions. The Sun bestows upon you a steady ambition that builds over time, and while early life may present challenges to your ego or position, the mature years typically bring recognition and respect. You value loyalty and expect the same from those around you. Spiritual pursuits appeal to you, particularly traditions that emphasize self-realization and the awakening of inner light, as the Sun is the significator of the higher self in Jyotish philosophy.`
  },
  Monday: {
    planet: 'Moon',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Monday, the day governed by the Moon (Chandra), the queen among the celestial luminaries in Vedic astrology. The Moon represents the mind (Manas), emotions, mother, nurturing instincts, and the capacity for empathy. Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra describes the Moon as the sustainer of all life and the reflector of consciousness, and those born under its day carry a deeply sensitive and intuitive nature. You are emotionally perceptive, often understanding the feelings of others before words are spoken. Your imagination is rich, and you possess a natural inclination toward creative arts, caregiving professions, or any vocation that requires emotional intelligence and the ability to connect with people on a personal level.

Your bond with your mother is especially significant and formative. According to Phaladeepika, Monday-born individuals are blessed with beauty, a pleasing countenance, and a love of comfort and domestic harmony. You value family life and find your greatest contentment in creating a nurturing home environment. However, because the Moon is inherently changeable—waxing and waning through its monthly cycle—your moods and mental states may fluctuate. You might experience periods of great enthusiasm followed by introspective withdrawal. Learning emotional equilibrium is a key life lesson for you. Water, travel across water, and occupations related to liquids, dairy, hospitality, or public-facing roles are strongly indicated.

Your health tendencies are connected to the Moon's governance of fluids in the body, the chest, and the lymphatic system. You should pay attention to hydration, digestive health, and emotional well-being, as stress can manifest as physical ailments more readily for you than for others. In relationships, you are devoted and seek deep emotional bonds rather than superficial connections. The Moon blesses you with popularity among the masses and an ability to intuitively gauge public sentiment, making you well suited for careers in counseling, nursing, hospitality, food industries, shipping, or the arts.`
  },
  Tuesday: {
    planet: 'Mars',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Tuesday, the day ruled by Mars (Mangala or Kuja), the commander-in-chief among the Navagraha. Mars represents courage, energy, physical strength, siblings, property, and the warrior spirit. According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Mars embodies the principle of action and initiative, and those born on Tuesday carry a dynamic, assertive, and fearless personality. You are naturally inclined toward competition, physical activity, and pursuits that demand boldness and quick decision-making. Whether in sports, military service, surgery, engineering, law enforcement, or entrepreneurship, you thrive in environments that challenge you and require decisive action.

Phaladeepika observes that Tuesday-born individuals possess a sharp intellect combined with physical vigor, though they must guard against impulsiveness and excessive anger. Your temperament is fiery and passionate—when channeled constructively, this energy makes you an unstoppable force for achievement, but when unchecked, it can lead to conflicts, accidents, or strained relationships. Land, property, and real estate are significant themes in your life, as Mars is the natural significator of immovable assets. You may accumulate wealth through property dealings, construction, or technical fields. Your relationship with siblings, especially brothers, carries karmic significance and may involve both strong bonds and occasional friction.

Health-wise, Mars governs the muscular system, blood, and adrenal glands. You are likely to have a strong physical constitution but should be mindful of inflammatory conditions, fevers, cuts, burns, and blood-related issues. Regular physical exercise is not merely beneficial but essential for your well-being, as it provides a constructive outlet for your abundant martial energy. In relationships, you are passionate and protective, though you need a partner who can match your intensity without being overwhelmed by it. Your courage and willingness to fight for what you believe in are among your greatest assets, and when tempered with patience, they lead to remarkable accomplishments.`
  },
  Wednesday: {
    planet: 'Mercury',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Wednesday, the day presided over by Mercury (Budha), the prince among the celestial bodies in Vedic astrology. Mercury represents intellect, communication, analytical reasoning, commerce, education, and youthfulness. According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Mercury is the planet of discrimination and learning, bestowing upon Wednesday-born individuals a quick wit, verbal dexterity, and an insatiable curiosity about the world. You possess a versatile mind that can grasp multiple subjects simultaneously, and you excel in fields requiring articulation, negotiation, and mental agility. Writing, teaching, accounting, trade, technology, and media are natural domains for your talents.

Phaladeepika notes that those born on Wednesday are blessed with a pleasant appearance, a good sense of humor, and the ability to adapt to diverse social situations with ease. You are a natural communicator who can bridge gaps between people and ideas, making you invaluable in collaborative environments. However, Mercury's mutable nature means you may sometimes struggle with indecisiveness or a tendency to scatter your energies across too many interests. Cultivating focus and depth in your pursuits, rather than merely breadth, is an important developmental theme. You are likely skilled in mathematics, languages, or any discipline that rewards logical analysis and pattern recognition. Commerce and trade come naturally to you, and you may find success in business ventures that involve intermediation, information, or skilled craftsmanship.

Your health is connected to Mercury's rulership of the nervous system, skin, and respiratory pathways. Mental overstimulation, anxiety, and skin conditions may arise when you are under excessive stress. Practices that calm the mind—such as pranayama, meditation, or spending time in nature—are particularly beneficial for you. In relationships, you seek intellectual compatibility above all else, and a partner who can engage you in stimulating conversation will hold your interest far more than one who offers only emotional or physical appeal. Your youthful energy and adaptability are lifelong gifts that keep you relevant and vibrant across all stages of life.`
  },
  Thursday: {
    planet: 'Jupiter',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Thursday, the day ruled by Jupiter (Guru or Brihaspati), the preceptor of the gods and the greatest benefic in Vedic astrology. Jupiter represents wisdom, dharma, expansion, higher learning, spirituality, children, and good fortune. According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Jupiter is the significator of divine grace, and those born on Thursday are endowed with an optimistic outlook, a generous spirit, and a natural inclination toward teaching, counseling, or guiding others. You carry an inherent sense of justice and morality that draws people to you for advice and mentorship. Your presence is often reassuring, and you possess the rare ability to see the larger picture even when others are mired in details.

Phaladeepika describes Thursday-born individuals as dignified, learned, and inclined toward religious or philosophical pursuits. You have a deep respect for tradition, scripture, and the accumulated wisdom of the ages, yet you also possess the capacity to interpret these teachings in ways that are relevant to contemporary life. Education is a lifelong pursuit for you—whether as a student, teacher, or both. Fields such as law, academia, finance, religion, philosophy, and advisory services are strongly favored. Jupiter's expansive nature may also manifest as a tendency toward weight gain or overindulgence, so moderation in diet and lifestyle is advisable. Your relationship with children is a source of great joy and fulfillment, and you are likely to be a devoted and encouraging parent.

Your health is influenced by Jupiter's governance of the liver, fat metabolism, and the arterial system. Maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise routine will help you avoid conditions related to excess, such as liver disorders, cholesterol issues, or diabetes. In matters of wealth, Jupiter blesses you with the ability to attract prosperity through ethical means, and you are more likely to accumulate wealth steadily through professional expertise than through speculative ventures. Spiritually, you are drawn to paths that emphasize knowledge, devotion, and service to the greater good, and you may find that your most meaningful life experiences are connected to moments of teaching, learning, or spiritual awakening.`
  },
  Friday: {
    planet: 'Venus',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Friday, the day governed by Venus (Shukra), the preceptor of the demons and the planet of beauty, love, luxury, and the arts in Vedic astrology. Venus represents refinement, sensory pleasures, creativity, romance, marriage, and material comforts. According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Venus is the greatest benefic for material life, and those born on Friday possess a natural appreciation for aesthetics, harmony, and the finer things in life. You are drawn to beauty in all its forms—whether in art, music, fashion, interior design, cuisine, or human relationships. Your charm and social grace make you popular in virtually any social setting, and you have an innate talent for creating pleasant environments and experiences.

Phaladeepika observes that Friday-born individuals are blessed with physical attractiveness, a love of luxury, and a talent for the creative arts. You may excel as an artist, musician, designer, entertainer, diplomat, or in any profession that values aesthetic sensibility and interpersonal finesse. Venus also governs wealth and vehicles, so you are likely to enjoy material comforts and may have a particular fondness for beautiful vehicles, clothing, and living spaces. In relationships, you are romantic, affectionate, and attentive, seeking a partnership that satisfies both emotional and aesthetic ideals. However, Venus's association with desire means you must guard against overindulgence, excessive attachment to pleasure, or allowing superficial attractions to undermine deeper commitments.

Your health is connected to Venus's rulership of the reproductive system, kidneys, and throat. Conditions related to these areas should be monitored, and maintaining a balanced approach to sensory pleasures will support your overall well-being. Creatively, you are among the most gifted of the weekday archetypes, and pursuing artistic expression—whether as a vocation or avocation—is essential for your happiness. In financial matters, Venus bestows both the desire for wealth and the charm to attract it, though your spending tendencies may require conscious management. Your life is enriched by beauty, love, and the cultivation of harmonious relationships, and your greatest fulfillment comes when you can share these gifts with others.`
  },
  Saturday: {
    planet: 'Saturn',
    prediction:
      `You are born on Saturday, the day ruled by Saturn (Shani), the great taskmaster and judge of karma in Vedic astrology. Saturn represents discipline, endurance, hard work, service, detachment, longevity, and the consequences of past actions. According to Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Saturn is the significator of perseverance and spiritual maturity, and those born on Saturday carry a serious, responsible, and deeply thoughtful temperament. You understand that lasting achievement requires sustained effort, and you are willing to put in the work that others may shy away from. While your path may involve more obstacles and delays than those of other weekday-born individuals, the rewards you earn are durable and hard-won, giving you a depth of character and resilience that is truly admirable.

Phaladeepika notes that Saturday-born individuals tend toward a lean physique, a contemplative demeanor, and a practical approach to life. You are not given to frivolous pursuits or empty displays of status; instead, you value substance, integrity, and the satisfaction of a job well done. Your career path may involve mining, agriculture, construction, engineering, labor management, social work, law, or any field that requires patience, organizational skill, and the ability to work within established structures. Saturn also governs servants, the working class, and democratic institutions, so you may feel a strong affinity for social justice, workers' rights, or public service. Early life may present financial or emotional challenges, but Saturn's blessing is that conditions improve steadily with age—your best years often come after thirty-six.

Health-wise, Saturn governs the skeletal system, joints, teeth, and the aging process. You should pay attention to bone health, dental care, and joint flexibility throughout life, as these areas are susceptible to wear. Cold, dry conditions and chronic ailments may be more common for you, making consistent preventive care important. In relationships, you are loyal, dependable, and deeply committed, though you may struggle with expressing emotions openly. A partner who appreciates your steadfast nature and gives you the space to process feelings at your own pace will be your ideal match. Your greatest life lesson is learning that the difficulties you face are not punishments but refinements—each challenge polishes you into a wiser, stronger, and more compassionate human being.`

// 2. Nakshatra Birth Predictions (27 Nakshatras)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

const nakshatraPredictions: Record<string, string> = {
  Ashwini:
    `Ashwini nakshatra, ruled by Ketu and presided over by the Ashwini Kumaras (the celestial physicians), bestows upon you a swift, healing, and pioneering nature. You are quick in thought and action, often the first to initiate new ventures or respond to emergencies. Your personality combines youthful enthusiasm with a natural aptitude for medicine, healing arts, or any field that involves restoring vitality and well-being. The Ashwini Kumaras represent miraculous healing and rejuvenation, and you carry this energy in your ability to bring fresh perspectives and rapid solutions to seemingly intractable problems.

In career matters, you excel in medicine, veterinary science, pharmacy, emergency services, transportation, horse training, or any occupation that demands speed, dexterity, and the courage to act decisively under pressure. You are an early starter who dislikes waiting for permission or consensus, preferring to forge ahead and deal with consequences as they arise. This pioneering spirit can lead to remarkable achievements, though it may also create friction with authority figures who prefer a more measured approach. Financial success comes through your initiative and willingness to take calculated risks rather than through inherited wealth or passive income.

Your relationships are characterized by enthusiasm and generosity, though you may sometimes move too quickly in romantic matters, committing before fully understanding your partner's nature. Learning patience in love is an important developmental theme. You are attracted to partners who are independent and energetic, as you have little tolerance for lethargy or passivity. Family life brings joy, particularly when you can maintain your sense of freedom within the domestic framework.

Health-wise, Ashwini governs the head and cerebral region. You should be mindful of headaches, head injuries, and cerebral conditions. Your natural vitality is strong, and you tend to recover quickly from illness, true to the healing nature of your nakshatra's ruling deities. Regular physical activity, particularly equestrian sports or activities involving speed, provides both physical benefit and psychological satisfaction.`,

  Bharani:
    `Bharani nakshatra, ruled by Venus and presided over by Yama (the god of death and dharma), gives you a complex personality that embodies both the creative and transformative aspects of existence. You possess a strong sense of duty, an unwavering moral compass, and a deep understanding that life involves both creation and dissolution. This nakshatra carries the symbolism of the womb and the yoni, representing the capacity to bear, nurture, and bring forth new life, ideas, and creative works. Your personality is intense, passionate, and marked by a willingness to confront difficult truths that others prefer to avoid.

In your career, you may be drawn to fields involving transformation, such as psychology, surgery, forensic science, taxation, insurance, crisis management, or the creative arts. Venus's influence bestows artistic talent, particularly in dramatic or emotionally intense forms of expression. You have the ability to take raw materials—whether physical, emotional, or intellectual—and transform them into something refined and valuable. Financial matters are significant in your life, and you have the potential to accumulate considerable wealth, though your relationship with money may involve cycles of abundance and scarcity that teach you deeper lessons about value and attachment.

In relationships, you are deeply passionate and possessive. You love with great intensity and expect the same level of commitment from your partner. Bharani individuals often experience significant romantic relationships that serve as catalysts for personal transformation. You are attracted to partners who have depth, emotional courage, and a willingness to engage with the full spectrum of human experience. Superficial relationships hold no appeal for you, and you would rather be alone than in a partnership that lacks genuine intimacy and emotional honesty.

Your health tendencies relate to Bharani's governance of the reproductive organs and lower abdomen. Conditions affecting these areas should be monitored throughout life. Your constitution is generally strong, but you may be prone to overexertion due to your intense nature. Learning to rest, restore, and allow natural cycles of activity and recovery will serve your long-term well-being. The transformative energy of Yama, when consciously directed, makes you a powerful agent of positive change in your community.`,

  Krittika:
    `Krittika nakshatra, ruled by the Sun and presided over by Agni (the fire god), bestows upon you a sharp, purifying, and radiant personality. You are direct in your speech, clear in your convictions, and unwilling to compromise on matters of truth and integrity. Like fire itself, you have the power to illuminate, warm, and transform, but also to burn away what is impure or false. This nakshatra spans the junction between Aries and Taurus, giving you both the pioneering courage of Aries and the stabilizing determination of Taurus. Your personality commands respect through its combination of moral clarity and practical competence.

Your career inclinations favor fields requiring precision, authority, and the application of heat or cutting: cooking and culinary arts, metallurgy, surgery, military leadership, criticism, editing, tailoring, and any profession where sharp tools—whether physical or intellectual—are employed. You have an excellent capacity for critical analysis and can quickly identify flaws in arguments, plans, or structures. This talent makes you valuable in quality control, auditing, and editorial roles, though you should be mindful that your directness does not alienate those who are more sensitive. Financial stability is important to you, and you are willing to work hard to ensure material security for yourself and your family.

In relationships, you are loyal, protective, and nurturing in a practical rather than sentimental way. You show love through acts of service and provision rather than through flowery words or grand romantic gestures. You expect honesty from your partner and can be unforgiving of deception or disloyalty. Your ideal partner is someone who appreciates your straightforward nature and shares your commitment to integrity. Family life is central to your identity, and you take your responsibilities as a parent or spouse very seriously, sometimes to the point of rigidity.

Health-wise, Krittika governs the neck, throat, and upper digestive tract. You should pay attention to thyroid function, sore throats, and digestive issues related to the stomach and upper intestines. Your fiery constitution means you run hot both physically and temperamentally—cooling foods, calming practices, and adequate hydration will help balance your natural intensity. When your fire is well tended, you are a beacon of warmth and clarity for all who know you.`,

  Rohini:
    `Rohini nakshatra, ruled by the Moon and presided over by Brahma (the creator), bestows upon you extraordinary charm, creativity, and fertility of mind and body. Rohini is considered the most favored nakshatra of the Moon, and your personality reflects this special status through an innate magnetism, artistic sensibility, and ability to attract abundance. You have a natural eye for beauty and quality, and you appreciate the sensory pleasures of life—fine food, beautiful surroundings, music, art, and luxurious textures. Your creative potential is immense, as Brahma's influence grants you the ability to bring new forms, ideas, and enterprises into being.

In career matters, you excel in agriculture, food production, fashion, cosmetics, hospitality, real estate, banking, luxury goods, fine arts, and entertainment. You have a talent for growing things, whether that manifests as cultivating crops, building businesses, developing real estate, or nurturing artistic projects from conception to completion. Your commercial instincts are strong, and you understand intuitively how to present products and experiences in their most appealing form. Financial prosperity is generally well indicated for Rohini-born individuals, as this nakshatra has a natural affinity for material abundance and the patient, steady approach needed to build lasting wealth.

Your relationships are characterized by deep romantic feelings, strong physical attraction, and a desire for stability and comfort in partnership. You are an attentive and devoted lover who enjoys creating a beautiful and harmonious home life. However, Rohini's association with jealousy and possessiveness means you must guard against becoming controlling or overly attached in romantic relationships. Your ideal partner is someone who shares your appreciation for beauty and comfort while also bringing emotional depth and loyalty to the relationship.

Health-wise, Rohini governs the face, mouth, throat, and palate. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as dietary excesses due to your love of fine food. Maintaining moderation in eating and drinking is important for your long-term health. Your constitution is generally robust and attractive, with a tendency toward fullness of figure that reflects Rohini's association with fertility and abundance. Regular exercise and mindful eating will help you maintain the radiant health that this beautiful nakshatra promises.`,

  Mrigashira:
    `Mrigashira nakshatra, ruled by Mars and presided over by Soma (the Moon god in his aspect as the celestial nectar), bestows upon you a searching, curious, and gentle yet restless personality. The symbol of this nakshatra is a deer's head, representing your perpetual quest for something beautiful, elusive, and transcendent. You are a natural seeker—always exploring new ideas, places, relationships, and experiences in search of that perfect fulfillment that seems always just beyond reach. This seeking nature makes you versatile, well-traveled, and broadly knowledgeable, though it can also lead to a pattern of starting things with great enthusiasm only to abandon them when the initial excitement fades.

In career matters, you excel in research, exploration, travel and tourism, music, textiles, sales and marketing, writing, and any field that rewards curiosity and the ability to communicate discoveries to others. Mars provides you with the energy and courage to venture into unknown territories, while Soma's influence gives you an aesthetic sensibility and appreciation for the finer aspects of whatever field you choose. You are particularly talented in fields that combine intellect with sensory appeal—perfumery, wine appreciation, music criticism, textile design, or gourmet cooking. Your financial path may involve periods of change and relocation, but your adaptability ensures that you can establish yourself in new environments relatively quickly.

In relationships, you are romantic, playful, and enjoy the thrill of courtship and mutual discovery. You are attracted to partners who are intellectually stimulating and who share your love of exploration and novelty. However, your restless nature can make long-term commitment challenging unless your partner understands your need for variety and mental stimulation within the relationship. The key to your romantic happiness lies in finding a partner who can be both a companion on your journey of discovery and a stable anchor when your searching nature becomes overwhelming.

Health-wise, Mrigashira governs the eyes, eyebrows, and the upper nasal region. You may experience sensitivity in these areas, including allergies, sinus conditions, or eye strain. Your nervous energy can sometimes manifest as anxiety or insomnia, particularly when you are between pursuits and feeling directionless. Establishing regular routines for rest, exercise, and meditation will help calm your restless mind and channel your abundant curiosity into productive and fulfilling endeavors.`,

  Ardra:
    `Ardra nakshatra, ruled by Rahu and presided over by Rudra (the fierce form of Shiva), bestows upon you an intense, penetrating, and transformative personality. The symbol of this nakshatra is a teardrop, representing the storms of life that bring destruction but also cleansing and renewal. You possess a sharp intellect that can cut through pretense and complexity to reveal underlying truths, much like a thunderstorm clears the air and reveals a fresh landscape. Your personality may appear harsh or intimidating to those who prefer comfortable illusions, but those who value honesty and depth recognize you as a powerful ally and insightful companion.

In career matters, you excel in technology, software engineering, electrical work, research, pharmaceutical sciences, surgery, investigative journalism, and any field that requires the ability to dissect complex systems and understand their inner workings. Rahu's influence gives you a fascination with the cutting edge of technology and science, while Rudra's energy provides the fierce determination needed to overcome obstacles that would deter less resilient individuals. You may experience significant career transformations during your life, with sudden changes that initially appear destructive but ultimately redirect you toward more authentic and fulfilling work. Financial patterns may be volatile, with periods of significant gain followed by unexpected losses, teaching you detachment from material security.

In relationships, you are intensely loyal once committed, but your path to commitment may involve significant emotional turbulence. You experience feelings deeply and express them powerfully, which can be overwhelming for more reserved partners. You need a relationship that can withstand honest expression of difficult emotions—grief, anger, frustration, and fear—without the other person retreating or retaliating. When you find such a partnership, your capacity for emotional depth and genuine intimacy is extraordinary.

Health-wise, Ardra governs the upper arms, shoulders, and the respiratory system. You may be susceptible to conditions involving these areas, as well as nervous system disorders and conditions related to mental overexertion. Your emotional intensity can manifest as physical symptoms if not properly processed, so developing healthy outlets for your powerful feelings—whether through creative expression, physical activity, or therapeutic work—is essential for your long-term well-being. The storms of Ardra, when navigated consciously, wash away the old and make way for genuine renewal.`,

  Punarvasu:
    `Punarvasu nakshatra, ruled by Jupiter and presided over by Aditi (the mother of the gods and the principle of boundlessness), bestows upon you an optimistic, resilient, and expansive personality. The name Punarvasu means "return of the light" or "restoration of goodness," and your life pattern often involves cycles of loss and recovery, each time returning to a better state than before. You possess a remarkable capacity for renewal—no matter what setbacks you face, you have the inner resources and philosophical perspective to rebuild, reframe, and move forward with renewed hope. This quality makes you an inspiring presence in the lives of those around you.

In career matters, you are drawn to education, counseling, spiritual teaching, philosophy, publishing, international commerce, and any field that involves the dissemination of knowledge and the expansion of horizons. Jupiter's influence gives you a natural teaching ability and a genuine desire to help others grow and improve their lives. You may also succeed in fields related to housing, hospitality, and providing shelter or refuge, as Aditi's nurturing boundlessness extends to the provision of safe spaces for others. Financial matters tend to work out favorably for you, often through fortunate timing, generous mentors, or the natural returns that come from ethical and service-oriented work.

In relationships, you are warm, generous, and forgiving. You believe in the goodness of people and are willing to give second chances where others might not. This generosity of spirit makes you a beloved friend and partner, though it can sometimes lead you to tolerate situations that you should have left behind sooner. Your ideal partner shares your philosophical outlook and your commitment to personal growth. Family life is important to you, and you often create a home environment that is welcoming, intellectually stimulating, and spiritually nourishing.

Health-wise, Punarvasu governs the nose, ears, and throat area, as well as the lungs and respiratory system. You may experience periodic health challenges in these areas, but your natural resilience typically ensures swift recovery. Your constitution benefits from moderate, consistent exercise and a diet that favors fresh, wholesome foods over processed or excessively rich fare. Spiritual practices, particularly those involving chanting, prayer, or devotional singing, are especially beneficial for your physical and psychological well-being, aligning your personal energies with the expansive, nurturing vibration of Aditi.`,

  Pushya:
    `Pushya nakshatra, ruled by Saturn and presided over by Brihaspati (Jupiter as the guru of the gods), is considered the most auspicious nakshatra for most activities in Vedic astrology. Born under this star, you possess a unique combination of Saturn's discipline and Jupiter's wisdom, creating a personality that is both practically competent and philosophically inclined. You are nourishing by nature—the symbol of Pushya is the udder of a cow, representing sustenance, generosity, and the selfless provision of resources. You derive genuine satisfaction from helping others grow and prosper, and your capacity for patient, sustained effort in service of others is remarkable.

In career matters, you excel in teaching, counseling, management, agriculture, dairy, food processing, government service, banking, and religious or charitable work. You are a natural institution builder who understands how to create systems and structures that serve people effectively over long periods. Saturn's influence ensures that you are practical, methodical, and reliable, while Brihaspati's energy gives you the vision and moral compass to direct your efforts toward worthy goals. Financial stability is well indicated, as your patient and conservative approach to money management typically leads to steady accumulation of wealth over time. You are unlikely to pursue get-rich-quick schemes, preferring the security of proven strategies and long-term investments.

In relationships, you are dependable, protective, and deeply committed. You may not be the most outwardly romantic partner, but your consistency, loyalty, and willingness to make sacrifices for your family's well-being speak louder than any grand romantic gesture. You seek a partner who values stability, shares your traditional values, and appreciates your quiet strength. Family is the center of your world, and you invest heavily in your children's education and moral development. Your home is likely to be well organized, comfortable, and welcoming—a reflection of Pushya's nourishing energy.

Health-wise, Pushya governs the chest, lungs, and stomach. You should be attentive to respiratory conditions, digestive issues, and chest-related ailments. Your constitution tends to be sturdy but may lack flexibility, so incorporating stretching, yoga, or gentle movement practices alongside more vigorous exercise is advisable. The nourishing quality of Pushya means you generally age well, with your best years often coming in the second half of life, as Saturn's delayed rewards finally manifest in full measure.`,

  Ashlesha:
    `Ashlesha nakshatra, ruled by Mercury and presided over by the Nagas (serpent deities), bestows upon you a penetrating, mystical, and deeply intuitive personality. You possess an extraordinary ability to read between the lines, understand hidden motivations, and navigate the unspoken dimensions of human interaction. The serpent symbolism of this nakshatra gives you a magnetic, hypnotic quality that can both attract and unsettle others. Your intelligence is serpentine in nature—flexible, cunning, and capable of approaching problems from angles that others cannot perceive. You are a natural psychologist who understands the depths of human nature, including its shadows.

In career matters, you excel in psychology, psychiatry, research, espionage, pharmacology, toxicology, occult sciences, astrology, healing arts (particularly those involving herbs, poisons, and kundalini energy), and any field that requires the ability to work with hidden or dangerous forces. Mercury's influence gives you excellent communication skills, though you tend to reveal information strategically rather than openly. You are skilled at negotiations, particularly those involving complex power dynamics or sensitive information. Financial success may come through unconventional means or through fields that others avoid due to their association with taboo subjects. Your approach to wealth is shrewd and calculating, and you rarely make financial decisions without careful analysis of all angles.

In relationships, you are deeply passionate but can be secretive, jealous, and possessive. Trust is a central issue for you—you guard your vulnerabilities fiercely and require extensive proof of loyalty before opening up to a partner. Once you do trust someone, your devotion is total, but betrayal of that trust is rarely forgiven. You need a partner who can handle your intensity, respect your need for privacy, and match your emotional depth without being overwhelmed by it. Your capacity for intimacy is profound, but it requires a safe container to express itself fully.

Health-wise, Ashlesha governs the joints, nails, and the entire nervous system with particular emphasis on the enteric nervous system of the gut. You may be prone to joint discomfort, nervous disorders, and digestive conditions, particularly those related to stress and anxiety. Your constitution benefits from practices that balance the nervous system, such as yoga nidra, meditation, and nature immersion. The kundalini energy associated with the Nagas is strong in you, and properly directed spiritual practice can transform your serpentine intensity into profound healing power and wisdom.`,

  Magha:
    `Magha nakshatra, ruled by Ketu and presided over by the Pitris (ancestral spirits), bestows upon you a regal, dignified, and tradition-honoring personality. You carry the weight of ancestral lineage with grace and feel a deep connection to your family heritage, cultural traditions, and the wisdom of past generations. The symbol of Magha is a royal throne, and your bearing naturally commands respect and authority. You possess an innate understanding of hierarchy, protocol, and the proper order of things, which can manifest as conservative values, respect for established institutions, and a desire to preserve what is valuable from the past while leading your community into the future.

In career matters, you are drawn to positions of authority and leadership, particularly in government, management, traditional arts, museum curation, heritage preservation, genealogy, archaeology, and any field that involves honoring the past while exercising present authority. Ketu's influence gives you a spiritual depth and detachment from material concerns that paradoxically makes you more effective in positions of worldly power—you lead not from ego but from a sense of duty and service to something larger than yourself. Financial success comes through your ability to command respect and leverage your natural authority, though you may be more concerned with legacy and reputation than with mere accumulation of wealth.

In relationships, you are proud, loyal, and generous. You seek a partner who matches your social standing and shares your respect for tradition and family honor. You can be magnanimous and indulgent with those you love, but you expect recognition and respect in return. A perceived slight to your dignity can provoke a disproportionate reaction, as your sense of self is closely tied to your perceived status and the respect of others. Learning to separate your intrinsic worth from external validation is an important life lesson for Magha-born individuals.

Health-wise, Magha governs the heart and the upper back. You should be attentive to cardiac health, blood pressure, and spinal conditions affecting the thoracic region. Your constitution is generally strong and vital, befitting your regal nakshatra, but pride may sometimes prevent you from seeking medical attention when needed. Regular cardiovascular exercise, stress management, and periodic cardiac checkups are advisable. Your connection to ancestral energies means that performing rituals honoring your ancestors (pitri tarpana) can have a noticeably positive effect on your overall health and life circumstances.`,

  'Purva Phalguni':
    `Purva Phalguni nakshatra, ruled by Venus and presided over by Bhaga (the god of marital bliss and good fortune), bestows upon you a charming, pleasure-loving, and creative personality. You are a natural enjoyer of life who believes that existence is meant to be savored rather than merely endured. The symbol of this nakshatra is the front legs of a bed or couch, representing rest, relaxation, and the intimate pleasures of life. Your personality radiates warmth, generosity, and a love of celebration that makes you a welcome presence at any social gathering. You have a talent for making others feel comfortable, appreciated, and happy in your company.

In career matters, you excel in entertainment, performing arts, event planning, hospitality, luxury goods, fashion, beauty, music, and any field that brings pleasure and joy to others. Venus's influence gives you a refined aesthetic sense, while Bhaga's energy bestows good fortune and an ability to attract favorable circumstances through your natural charm and positive attitude. You are creative, artistic, and drawn to pursuits that combine beauty with self-expression. Financial matters tend to be favorable, as your likability and social skills open doors to lucrative opportunities, though your love of luxury may sometimes strain your budget.

In relationships, you are romantic, affectionate, and devoted. Love is a central theme in your life, and you invest heavily in your romantic partnerships. You are generous with both material gifts and emotional attention, creating a warm and loving atmosphere in your relationships. However, your strong desire for pleasure and companionship can sometimes lead to hasty romantic decisions or difficulty being alone. Learning to cultivate self-sufficiency and inner contentment, rather than depending entirely on partnership for happiness, is an important developmental theme.

Health-wise, Purva Phalguni governs the reproductive organs, lower back, and lips. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as indulgence-related health issues such as weight gain, diabetes, or liver conditions from excessive consumption. Your natural vitality is strong, but it requires maintenance through regular exercise and dietary moderation. The pleasure-loving nature of this nakshatra is a genuine gift, but like all gifts, it must be managed wisely to yield its full blessings without creating imbalance.`,

  'Uttara Phalguni':
    `Uttara Phalguni nakshatra, ruled by the Sun and presided over by Aryaman (the god of patronage, contracts, and social bonds), bestows upon you a helpful, responsible, and socially connected personality. While your neighboring nakshatra Purva Phalguni represents the enjoyment of pleasure, Uttara Phalguni represents the responsibilities and commitments that follow—the morning after the celebration, when agreements must be honored and relationships maintained. You are a person of your word who takes commitments seriously and builds your reputation on reliability, competence, and fair dealing. Your personality combines warmth with a strong sense of duty, making you an excellent friend, partner, and colleague.

In career matters, you excel in social work, human resources, contract law, diplomacy, counseling, healing professions, administration, and any field that involves bringing people together, facilitating agreements, or serving as a bridge between different interests. The Sun's influence gives you natural authority and leadership ability, while Aryaman's energy makes you particularly skilled in matters involving partnerships, treaties, and social contracts. You are often found in roles that require you to balance competing interests and find solutions that serve the greater good. Financial stability is generally well indicated, as your reliability and competence attract steady employment and opportunities for advancement.

In relationships, you are committed, supportive, and deeply invested in the success of your partnerships. You approach marriage and long-term relationships with the seriousness and dedication that Aryaman embodies—as sacred contracts that must be honored and nurtured. You are generous with your time, energy, and resources in support of your partner's growth and well-being. However, you may sometimes struggle with a tendency to give more than you receive, leading to resentment or exhaustion. Learning to establish healthy boundaries and to receive as graciously as you give is important for your relationship satisfaction.

Health-wise, Uttara Phalguni governs the lower back, spine, and the adrenal glands. You may experience conditions related to spinal alignment, lower back pain, or adrenal fatigue, particularly during periods of excessive responsibility or service to others. Your constitution benefits from practices that strengthen the core and support the spine, such as yoga, swimming, or Pilates. Adequate rest and self-care are essential, as your natural inclination to serve others can lead you to neglect your own needs until health issues force a recalibration.`,

  Hasta:
    `Hasta nakshatra, ruled by the Moon and presided over by Savitar (the solar deity of the early morning, representing creative inspiration and skillful action), bestows upon you remarkable manual dexterity, practical intelligence, and a talent for craftsmanship. The symbol of this nakshatra is an open hand, representing skill, industriousness, and the power to grasp and manipulate both physical objects and abstract concepts. You possess an unusual combination of creative vision and practical ability—you can not only imagine beautiful or useful things but also make them with your own hands. This makes you both an artist and an artisan, capable of turning ideas into tangible realities.

In career matters, you excel in crafts, surgery, painting, sculpture, writing, weaving, computing (particularly programming and design), card magic and sleight of hand, healing through touch (massage, acupressure, chiropractic), and any field that rewards precise hand skills and attention to detail. The Moon's influence gives you intuitive understanding and emotional sensitivity, while Savitar's energy provides the creative spark and the discipline to refine your skills through sustained practice. You are remarkably resourceful, often able to improvise solutions using whatever materials are available. Financial success comes through your skills and craftsmanship, and you may earn well through specialized expertise that few others possess.

In relationships, you are caring, considerate, and attentive to your partner's needs. You show love through practical gestures—fixing things, creating gifts, managing household details—rather than through grand declarations. Your observational skills make you keenly attuned to your partner's moods and unspoken needs, though you may sometimes use this perceptiveness to manipulate rather than to serve. Cultivating straightforward communication alongside your natural intuitive understanding will strengthen your relationships immeasurably.

Health-wise, Hasta governs the hands, fingers, and the upper extremities generally. You may be prone to conditions affecting the hands, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis of the fingers, or skin conditions on the palms. Your nervous system is sensitive and responsive, making you susceptible to stress-related conditions when your creative energies are blocked or your skills underutilized. Engaging in creative handiwork—whether professional or recreational—is therapeutic for you, providing both emotional satisfaction and nervous system regulation.`,

  Chitra:
    `Chitra nakshatra, ruled by Mars and presided over by Tvashtar (Vishwakarma, the celestial architect and divine craftsman), bestows upon you a brilliant, creative, and aesthetically gifted personality. The name Chitra means "the brilliant one" or "the beautiful one," and you possess a natural radiance that draws attention wherever you go. Your creative abilities are exceptional, and you have an innate understanding of form, color, proportion, and design that goes beyond mere taste to approach genuine artistic vision. Tvashtar's influence gives you the ability to envision and create structures, designs, and works of art that combine beauty with functionality.

In career matters, you excel in architecture, fashion design, jewelry making, interior design, graphic design, photography, filmmaking, engineering, and any field that requires the ability to visualize and create beautiful, well-structured forms. Mars's influence provides the energy, ambition, and competitive drive to succeed in demanding creative fields, while Tvashtar's energy ensures that your creations have both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. You are not content with mediocrity—you strive for excellence in everything you produce, and your standards for quality are exacting. Financial success is well indicated through your creative talents, particularly if you can establish yourself as a specialist in a high-value creative niche.

In relationships, you are attractive, charming, and drawn to partners who appreciate beauty and creativity. You have high standards for physical appearance and aesthetic compatibility in your relationships, which can sometimes make you appear superficial. However, your appreciation for beauty runs deeper than mere surface appearance—you are attracted to the beauty of character, intellect, and creative spirit as well. Your ideal partner is someone who stimulates your creative vision and shares your commitment to living a beautiful, well-designed life.

Health-wise, Chitra governs the forehead, neck, and the upper body musculature. You may experience conditions related to these areas, including tension headaches, neck stiffness, and skin conditions affecting the forehead. Mars's fiery influence can create inflammatory conditions, and your intense creative drive may lead to periods of burnout if you do not balance productivity with adequate rest. Physical exercise that combines strength with flexibility—such as martial arts, dance, or swimming—suits your constitution well and helps channel your Mars energy constructively.`,

  Swati:
    `Swati nakshatra, ruled by Rahu and presided over by Vayu (the wind god), bestows upon you an independent, adaptable, and freedom-loving personality. The symbol of this nakshatra is a young plant shoot blowing in the wind, representing flexibility, resilience, and the ability to bend without breaking. You possess a remarkable capacity for adaptation—you can thrive in diverse environments, cultures, and social settings, adjusting your approach without losing your essential identity. Your independence is a core value, and you resist any situation or relationship that threatens to constrain your freedom of movement and expression.

In career matters, you excel in trade, commerce, travel-related industries, import-export, diplomacy, legal practice, social work, and any field that involves connecting different worlds, cultures, or markets. Rahu's influence gives you ambition, innovation, and a talent for seeing opportunities where others see only obstacles, while Vayu's energy provides mobility, communication skill, and the ability to influence through subtle persuasion rather than brute force. You are a natural networker who builds bridges between diverse communities and interests. Financial success often comes through business acumen, particularly in ventures that involve international connections or the movement of goods and ideas across boundaries.

In relationships, you value independence and equality. You need a partner who respects your autonomy and does not attempt to control or restrict you. At the same time, Swati's airy nature can make you somewhat detached in emotional matters, and you may need to consciously cultivate deeper emotional intimacy in your partnerships. Your ideal relationship is one of companionate friendship combined with mutual respect and shared intellectual interests, rather than one based primarily on passionate intensity or emotional dependency.

Health-wise, Swati governs the intestines, kidneys, and the skin. You may be prone to digestive conditions, particularly those involving the small intestine, as well as kidney conditions and skin sensitivities, especially to wind and environmental allergens. Your constitution is adaptable but can be vulnerable to imbalance when environmental conditions change rapidly. Building a stable daily routine, even within your dynamic lifestyle, will provide the grounding that Vayu's restless energy sometimes lacks. Practices such as yoga, tai chi, or mindful breathing are particularly beneficial for calming your naturally active mind.`,

  Vishakha:
    `Vishakha nakshatra, ruled by Jupiter and presided over by Indra and Agni together (the king of the gods and the fire god), bestows upon you an ambitious, determined, and goal-oriented personality with extraordinary willpower. The symbol of this nakshatra is a triumphal gateway decorated with leaves, representing the celebration of achievement and the focused pursuit of clearly defined objectives. You possess a single-minded intensity that, once directed toward a goal, makes you virtually unstoppable. Your capacity for sustained effort over long periods, combined with your willingness to sacrifice short-term pleasures for long-term success, distinguishes you from less focused individuals.

In career matters, you excel in politics, management, marketing, public speaking, law, competitive sports, military leadership, religious leadership, and any field that requires the ability to rally others around a shared vision and persist through obstacles until the goal is achieved. Jupiter's influence gives you a broad vision and philosophical perspective, while the combined energies of Indra (power and leadership) and Agni (transformative fire) provide the drive and authority needed to turn that vision into reality. You are particularly effective in competitive environments where your intensity and determination give you an edge over less committed rivals. Financial success is strongly indicated, though it typically comes through persistent effort rather than sudden windfalls.

In relationships, you are passionate, devoted, and sometimes obsessive. When you commit to a relationship, you bring the same intensity and determination that characterize your professional life, which can be both flattering and overwhelming for your partner. You need a partner who can match your energy and ambition, or at least support and appreciate your drive without feeling neglected. Jealousy can be an issue, as your possessive nature may conflict with your partner's need for independence. Learning to trust and release control in your intimate relationships is a significant growth area.

Health-wise, Vishakha governs the lower abdomen, kidneys, bladder, and the pancreas. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as stress-related disorders arising from your intense lifestyle. Your driven nature can lead to neglect of basic self-care during periods of focused pursuit, so establishing non-negotiable health routines—regular meals, adequate sleep, consistent exercise—is essential. When your tremendous energy is balanced with adequate rest and recovery, you are capable of achievements that others can only dream of.`,

  Anuradha:
    `Anuradha nakshatra, ruled by Saturn and presided over by Mitra (the god of friendship, cooperation, and devotion), bestows upon you a loyal, disciplined, and socially conscious personality with a remarkable talent for building and maintaining deep relationships. The name Anuradha means "following Radha" or "subsequent success," suggesting that your achievements come through sustained effort and devotion rather than initial brilliance. You are a team player who understands the value of cooperation, mutual support, and shared sacrifice. Your ability to forge genuine connections across social, cultural, and economic divides makes you an invaluable member of any community or organization.

In career matters, you excel in organizational leadership, diplomacy, international relations, research, mathematics, mining, insurance, and any field that requires patience, precision, and the ability to work collaboratively toward long-term goals. Saturn's influence gives you discipline, endurance, and the capacity to function effectively within structured environments, while Mitra's energy bestows diplomatic skill and the ability to build alliances based on mutual respect and shared interest. You may find success in foreign lands or in fields that involve cross-cultural communication, as your adaptive nature and genuine interest in others enable you to build bridges across difference.

In relationships, you are devoted, loyal, and deeply committed. Friendship is the foundation of your romantic relationships—you need to genuinely like and respect your partner before deeper feelings can develop. You are capable of maintaining lifelong friendships and partnerships, as your combination of loyalty, patience, and willingness to work through difficulties makes you a steadfast companion. However, Saturn's influence can sometimes create emotional reserve or difficulty expressing tender feelings, and you may need to consciously practice emotional openness to maintain intimacy.

Health-wise, Anuradha governs the pelvic region, hips, bladder, and the reproductive organs. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as chronic conditions that develop slowly over time—consistent with Saturn's influence. Your constitution benefits from regular physical activity, particularly exercises that strengthen the hips and lower back, and from practices that promote emotional release and connection. The devotional qualities of Mitra suggest that spiritual practice involving community worship, chanting with others, or service-oriented activities are particularly beneficial for your overall well-being.`,

  Jyeshtha:
    `Jyeshtha nakshatra, ruled by Mercury and presided over by Indra (the king of the gods), bestows upon you a commanding, protective, and intellectually formidable personality. The name Jyeshtha means "the eldest" or "the chief," and you naturally assume positions of authority and responsibility, often becoming the leader or protector of your group from an early age. You possess a sharp, strategic mind that quickly assesses power dynamics and understands how to leverage your position for maximum effect. Your protective instincts are strong—you defend those under your care with fierce determination and expect loyalty in return.

In career matters, you excel in management, politics, military leadership, intelligence services, crisis management, executive roles, and any field that places you in charge of protecting or directing others. Mercury's influence gives you excellent communication and analytical skills, while Indra's energy provides the commanding presence and decisiveness needed for leadership in challenging situations. You are particularly effective during crises, when your cool-headed strategic thinking and ability to make tough decisions under pressure distinguish you from less resilient leaders. Financial success is generally well indicated, as your combination of intelligence and authority opens doors to lucrative positions of responsibility.

In relationships, you are protective, generous with your resources, and expect to be respected as the senior partner—regardless of actual age or experience. This authoritative approach can create tension with partners who value egalitarian relationships, and learning to share power and decision-making in your intimate relationships is an important growth area. You are loyal and committed once you choose a partner, and you express love through protection, provision, and taking responsibility for your family's well-being.

Health-wise, Jyeshtha governs the colon, reproductive organs, and the muscular system. You may be prone to conditions affecting the lower digestive tract, muscular tension, and stress-related disorders arising from the weight of responsibilities you carry. Your constitution is generally strong but can be undermined by the tendency to internalize stress rather than expressing or processing it. Regular physical exercise, particularly activities that build strength and release tension—such as weightlifting, martial arts, or vigorous swimming—will help you manage the physical demands of your naturally intense lifestyle.`,

  Mula:
    `Mula nakshatra, ruled by Ketu and presided over by Nirriti (the goddess of destruction and dissolution), bestows upon you a penetrating, investigative, and transformative personality that seeks to understand the root causes of all phenomena. The name Mula means "root," and your fundamental drive is to dig beneath the surface of life to discover what lies at its foundation. You are a natural philosopher, researcher, and spiritual seeker who is not satisfied with superficial explanations or conventional wisdom. Your willingness to question established assumptions and explore uncomfortable truths makes you a powerful agent of transformation, though it can also create conflict with those who prefer the comfort of unexamined beliefs.

In career matters, you excel in research, investigation, herbalism, root medicine, archaeology, geology, philosophy, nuclear science, genetics, and any field that involves going to the root of things. Ketu's influence gives you a detached, penetrating insight that allows you to see through illusions and pretenses, while Nirriti's energy provides the courage to confront and dismantle structures that no longer serve their original purpose. You may experience significant career disruptions during your life—sudden endings that initially appear catastrophic but ultimately free you to pursue more authentic work. Financial patterns may be unconventional, with periods of austerity alternating with unexpected abundance.

In relationships, you are intense, honest, and sometimes brutally direct. You have no patience for pretense or game-playing in romantic matters, and you need a partner who can handle unvarnished truth without feeling attacked. Your relationships tend to be transformative for both partners, as your penetrating insight reveals hidden patterns and unspoken dynamics that, once brought to consciousness, can either deepen the bond or expose its fundamental incompatibility. You are attracted to partners with spiritual depth, philosophical inclination, and the courage to face difficult truths about themselves and the relationship.

Health-wise, Mula governs the feet, sciatic nerve, and the hips. You may be prone to sciatica, foot problems, and hip conditions, as well as sudden health crises that serve as wake-up calls for necessary lifestyle changes. Your constitution benefits from grounding practices—walking barefoot on earth, spending time in nature, and engaging in physical activities that connect you to the body and the ground. Spiritual practices involving root chakra work, meditation on foundational principles, and the study of scriptures that explore the nature of reality are particularly beneficial for channeling Mula's powerful transformative energy constructively.`,

  'Purva Ashadha':
    `Purva Ashadha nakshatra, ruled by Venus and presided over by Apas (the water deity representing the purifying and invigorating power of water), bestows upon you an invincible, persuasive, and energizing personality. The name Purva Ashadha means "the unvanquished" or "the former invincible one," and you possess an unshakable conviction in your beliefs, values, and chosen causes that can be both inspiring and formidable. Your persuasive abilities are exceptional—you can influence others through a combination of charismatic presentation, emotional appeal, and genuine conviction that makes your arguments compelling even to skeptics.

In career matters, you excel in law, advocacy, public speaking, broadcasting, water-related industries, shipping, beverages, counseling, and any field that involves persuading or inspiring others. Venus's influence gives you charm, aesthetic sensibility, and social grace, while Apas provides purifying energy that allows you to revitalize and refresh ideas, projects, and organizations that have become stagnant. You have a talent for taking something that has lost its appeal and presenting it in a fresh, invigorating way. Financial success comes through your persuasive abilities and your capacity to generate enthusiasm and commitment in others, whether as a leader, salesperson, or advocate.

In relationships, you are passionate, romantic, and confident. You approach love with the same conviction and energy that characterize your professional life, and you are not easily discouraged by rejection or obstacles in your romantic pursuits. Your confidence and charm make you attractive to potential partners, and you enjoy the process of courtship and persuasion. However, your strong convictions can sometimes make you inflexible in relationships, and learning to listen and compromise is an important developmental theme. Your ideal partner is someone who admires your strength while having enough independent spirit to maintain their own identity within the relationship.

Health-wise, Purva Ashadha governs the thighs, hips, and the sciatic region. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as kidney and reproductive conditions associated with Venus's governance. Your constitution benefits from regular hydration, swimming, and water-based therapies, consistent with the aquatic associations of Apas. The purifying energy of this nakshatra also suggests that periodic cleansing practices—whether physical (fasting, detoxification) or spiritual (pilgrimage, retreat)—are particularly beneficial for maintaining your vitality and conviction.`,

  'Uttara Ashadha':
    `Uttara Ashadha nakshatra, ruled by the Sun and presided over by the Vishvedevas (the universal gods representing all virtues and collective cosmic order), bestows upon you an upright, virtuous, and universally respected personality. The name Uttara Ashadha means "the latter invincible one," and your invincibility comes not from aggressive force but from the unassailable strength of your character, ethics, and commitment to universal principles. You possess a natural moral authority that others recognize and defer to, even when they disagree with your specific positions. Your leadership style is inclusive, principled, and focused on the common good rather than personal advantage.

In career matters, you excel in government service, the judiciary, civil service, non-profit leadership, international organizations, academia, and any field that involves upholding standards, maintaining order, and serving the public interest. The Sun's influence gives you dignity, authority, and a strong sense of purpose, while the Vishvedevas provide a broad, inclusive perspective that considers the needs of all stakeholders rather than favoring narrow interests. You are particularly effective in roles that require mediating between competing interests and finding solutions that serve the greater good. Financial matters are generally stable, as your integrity and competence attract steady advancement and the trust of institutions and individuals who control resources.

In relationships, you are devoted, ethical, and committed to building a partnership based on mutual respect, shared values, and genuine companionship. You take marriage and family life seriously, viewing them as sacred responsibilities rather than mere social conventions. Your partner can rely on you absolutely—your word is your bond, and you will sacrifice personal comfort for the well-being of your family without hesitation. However, your strong principles can sometimes make you rigid or judgmental, and learning to extend grace and flexibility to imperfect human beings (including yourself) is an important life lesson.

Health-wise, Uttara Ashadha governs the thighs, knees, and the skin. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as conditions related to overwork and excessive self-sacrifice. Your constitution is generally strong and enduring, but your tendency to carry heavy responsibilities can lead to chronic stress and its associated health consequences. Regular exercise, particularly walking, hiking, or other activities that strengthen the legs and connect you to nature, is beneficial. Practices that cultivate inner peace and self-compassion are essential for balancing your outward-focused, duty-oriented nature.`,

  Shravana:
    `Shravana nakshatra, ruled by the Moon and presided over by Vishnu (the preserver god who maintains cosmic order), bestows upon you a perceptive, learned, and socially skilled personality with an exceptional capacity for listening, learning, and transmitting knowledge. The name Shravana means "hearing" or "listening," and your primary mode of engaging with the world is through attentive listening and observation. You absorb information from your environment with remarkable efficiency, and your memory for conversations, stories, and subtle details is extraordinary. This makes you an excellent counselor, teacher, journalist, or researcher—anyone who benefits from the ability to listen deeply and synthesize what they hear into coherent understanding.

In career matters, you excel in education, counseling, music, broadcasting, journalism, publishing, telecommunications, and any field that involves the transmission of knowledge through spoken or written word. The Moon's influence gives you emotional sensitivity and intuitive understanding, while Vishnu's preserving energy provides a sense of continuity, tradition, and the importance of maintaining valuable knowledge across generations. You are a natural connector of ideas and people, often serving as the person who links different communities, disciplines, or perspectives through your broad listening and comprehensive understanding. Financial success comes through your knowledge, communication skills, and ability to build networks of mutual benefit.

In relationships, you are attentive, supportive, and genuinely interested in understanding your partner's inner world. You are the rare person who actually listens when your partner speaks, and your empathetic responses make your partner feel truly heard and understood. This quality alone makes you a highly valued partner and friend. However, your receptive nature can sometimes lead to passivity or difficulty asserting your own needs, and learning to speak up and advocate for yourself is an important developmental theme. Your ideal partner appreciates your listening gifts and reciprocates by showing genuine interest in your thoughts and feelings.

Health-wise, Shravana governs the ears, hearing apparatus, and the lower extremities including the knees. You may be prone to ear infections, hearing conditions, and knee problems, particularly as you age. Your constitution is sensitive and responsive to environmental stimuli, making you susceptible to noise-related stress and the need for quiet, restorative environments. Practices that involve sound healing—mantra chanting, listening to devotional music, or sound meditation—are particularly beneficial for your health, aligning with the auditory nature of your nakshatra.`,

  Dhanishta:
    `Dhanishta nakshatra, ruled by Mars and presided over by the Vasus (the eight elemental deities of nature), bestows upon you a wealthy, ambitious, and musically gifted personality with strong connections to material prosperity and rhythmic expression. The name Dhanishta means "the wealthiest" or "the most famous," and you possess a natural magnetism that attracts both material abundance and public recognition. The symbol of this nakshatra is a drum (mridanga), representing your connection to rhythm, music, and the vibrational frequencies that underlie both artistic expression and material prosperity. You have an instinctive understanding that wealth flows according to natural rhythms and cycles, and your success comes from aligning your efforts with these patterns.

In career matters, you excel in music, dance, real estate, property management, group leadership, sports, military service, engineering, and any field that involves working with groups, managing resources, or creating rhythmic structures. Mars's influence provides ambition, courage, and competitive drive, while the Vasus bestow material blessings and the ability to work harmoniously with natural forces. You are particularly effective in team environments, where your combination of individual drive and group awareness makes you a natural leader who elevates the performance of everyone around you. Financial success is strongly indicated, as Dhanishta is one of the most materially auspicious nakshatras in the Vedic system.

In relationships, you are generous, socially active, and enjoy a vibrant social life with your partner. You are drawn to partners who share your energy, ambition, and appreciation for the good things in life. Your relationships are often characterized by active engagement in social events, cultural activities, and community life. However, the Mars influence can create a tendency toward competitiveness or control within relationships, and learning to collaborate rather than dominate in your intimate partnerships is an important growth area. You may also need to guard against prioritizing social status or material acquisition over emotional intimacy.

Health-wise, Dhanishta governs the back, ankles, and the circulatory system. You may be prone to back problems, ankle injuries, and circulatory conditions, particularly those related to high blood pressure or arterial issues. Your energetic constitution requires regular physical activity to maintain health, and rhythmic exercise—dance, drumming, running, or cycling—is particularly beneficial, aligning your physical movement with the rhythmic energy of your nakshatra. Musical engagement, whether as a performer or listener, has therapeutic value for you, helping to regulate your nervous system and promote overall well-being.`,

  Shatabhisha:
    `Shatabhisha nakshatra, ruled by Rahu and presided over by Varuna (the god of cosmic waters, truth, and celestial order), bestows upon you a solitary, intellectual, and healing personality with a talent for working with hidden or mysterious forces. The name Shatabhisha means "one hundred physicians" or "one hundred cures," and you possess a natural aptitude for healing, particularly through unconventional, alternative, or technologically innovative methods. You are a private person who values your independence and solitude, preferring to work behind the scenes rather than in the spotlight. Your intellectual capacity is formidable, and you approach problems with a detached, analytical perspective that allows you to see solutions that more emotionally involved individuals might miss.

In career matters, you excel in medicine (particularly research and specialized fields), astronomy, space science, technology, electricity, nuclear science, pharmaceutical research, alternative healing, and any field that involves working with invisible forces or decoding complex systems. Rahu's influence gives you a fascination with the unconventional, the futuristic, and the boundary-pushing, while Varuna's energy provides a deep connection to truth, cosmic order, and the hidden laws that govern the universe. You are innovative and ahead of your time, often developing ideas or approaches that are initially dismissed but later recognized as ahead of their time.

In relationships, you are reserved, selective, and require a great deal of personal space. You are not antisocial, but you need more solitude than most people to process your thoughts, recharge your energy, and maintain your inner equilibrium. Your ideal partner is someone who respects your need for privacy, shares your intellectual interests, and does not demand constant emotional engagement. When you do open up to a trusted partner, your insights, loyalty, and quiet devotion make you a deeply valued companion. However, emotional expression does not come naturally to you, and developing the ability to communicate your feelings clearly is an important relationship skill to cultivate.

Health-wise, Shatabhisha governs the calves, shins, and the circulatory system, particularly the veins. You may be prone to varicose veins, circulatory conditions, and electrical disturbances in the body such as irregular heartbeat. Your constitution is unusual and may not respond well to conventional medical approaches, so exploring alternative or integrative healing modalities is advisable. The isolation and intellectual intensity of this nakshatra can also create vulnerability to depression, anxiety, or obsessive thinking patterns, making social connection (even in small doses) and physical exercise important components of your wellness routine.`,

  'Purva Bhadrapada':
    `Purva Bhadrapada nakshatra, ruled by Jupiter and presided over by Aja Ekapada (the one-footed serpent of the cosmic fire), bestows upon you an intense, transformative, and spiritually powerful personality that operates at the extremes of human experience. The symbol of this nakshatra is the front legs of a funeral cot or a two-faced man, representing the duality between your worldly ambitions and your spiritual aspirations. You possess tremendous energy that can be directed toward either material conquest or spiritual transformation, and your life journey often involves navigating the tension between these two poles. Your intensity is palpable, and your capacity to focus your formidable will on a chosen objective makes you a force to be reckoned with in any arena.

In career matters, you excel in occult sciences, astrology, tantric practices, research, philosophy, extreme sports, financial speculation, mortuary science, and any field that involves working at the boundaries between the known and unknown, the material and spiritual, or life and death. Jupiter's influence provides wisdom, moral perspective, and a genuine desire to use your power for the benefit of others, while Aja Ekapada's energy provides the fierce, uncompromising intensity needed to penetrate the deepest mysteries. Financial patterns may be extreme, with periods of great wealth alternating with periods of austerity, reflecting the nakshatra's all-or-nothing energy.

In relationships, you are passionate, devoted, and sometimes overwhelming in your intensity. You love deeply and expect the same depth of commitment from your partner. Your relationships tend to be transformative experiences that fundamentally change both partners, for better or worse. You need a partner who can handle your intensity without being consumed by it, and who has their own independent spiritual or philosophical life to complement yours. Superficial relationships hold no appeal for you, and you would rather face solitude than settle for a partnership that lacks genuine depth and transformative potential.

Health-wise, Purva Bhadrapada governs the ankles, feet, and the left side of the body. You may be prone to conditions affecting these areas, as well as feverish conditions and inflammatory disorders reflecting the fiery energy of Aja Ekapada. Your constitution is powerful but can be volatile, and learning to manage your intense energy through disciplined spiritual practice, regular exercise, and adequate rest is essential. The transformative energy of this nakshatra, when properly channeled through meditation, yoga, or devoted service, can lead to profound spiritual advancement and the ability to serve as a powerful healer and guide for others.`,

  'Uttara Bhadrapada':
    `Uttara Bhadrapada nakshatra, ruled by Saturn and presided over by Ahir Budhnya (the serpent of the deep, associated with the cosmic ocean and kundalini energy), bestows upon you a deep, contemplative, and spiritually mature personality that embodies wisdom, compassion, and the ability to transcend worldly limitations. While Purva Bhadrapada represents the fierce, transformative aspect of spiritual energy, Uttara Bhadrapada represents its calm, integrated, and compassionate expression. You possess a depth of understanding and emotional maturity that is rare, and your presence has a calming, stabilizing effect on those around you. You are a natural sage—someone who has integrated life experience into genuine wisdom.

In career matters, you excel in spiritual teaching, counseling, charitable work, end-of-life care, hospice, yoga instruction, meditation teaching, writing (particularly on philosophical or spiritual subjects), and any field that involves deep compassion, patience, and the ability to sit with human suffering without being overwhelmed by it. Saturn's influence provides discipline, endurance, and the capacity for sustained spiritual practice, while Ahir Budhnya's energy gives you access to deep psychic currents and the wisdom that comes from contemplating the fundamental mysteries of existence. Financial matters are generally stable but modest, as your priorities tend to be spiritual rather than material. You accumulate enough for comfort but rarely pursue wealth as a primary goal.

In relationships, you are loyal, patient, and deeply compassionate. You accept your partner's flaws with grace and offer genuine support during difficult times. Your emotional depth and stability make you a profoundly reassuring partner, and your relationships tend to deepen over time rather than burning bright and fading. You may attract partners who are going through difficult transitions, as your calming presence and wise counsel serve as an anchor during storms. Your ideal partner shares your spiritual inclinations and appreciates the quiet, deep quality of your love.

Health-wise, Uttara Bhadrapada governs the feet, toes, and the skeletal system of the lower extremities. You may be prone to conditions affecting the feet, such as plantar fasciitis, flat feet, or gout, as well as conditions related to Saturn's governance of chronic, slow-developing ailments. Your constitution benefits from gentle, sustained exercise such as walking, swimming, or yoga, rather than intense athletic activity. Spiritual practices involving deep meditation, contemplation, and pranayama are essential for maintaining your inner equilibrium and accessing the profound wisdom that your nakshatra promises.`,

  Revati:
    `Revati nakshatra, ruled by Mercury and presided over by Pushan (the nourishing sun god who protects travelers and guides souls to the afterlife), bestows upon you a gentle, prosperous, and spiritually refined personality that embodies the completion and fulfillment of the entire nakshatra cycle. As the final nakshatra in the zodiac, Revati represents the end of a journey and the preparation for a new beginning, and you carry this energy of completion, integration, and transcendence in your personality. You are nurturing, generous, and genuinely concerned with the well-being of others, particularly those who are lost, vulnerable, or in need of guidance.

In career matters, you excel in animal care and veterinary medicine, travel and pilgrimage organization, spiritual counseling, charity work, foster care, road and infrastructure planning, navigation, and any field that involves guiding others toward their destination—whether physical, emotional, or spiritual. Mercury's influence gives you communication skills, practical intelligence, and the ability to organize complex logistics, while Pushan's energy provides a nurturing, protective quality that draws those in need to your care. You may find success in fields related to the ocean, fisheries, or maritime industries, as well as in creative arts, particularly music and poetry. Financial success comes through service, generosity, and the trust that others place in your integrity and competence.

In relationships, you are gentle, romantic, and deeply devoted. You love with an open, uncomplicated heart and seek a partner who reciprocates your sincerity and affection. You are naturally accommodating and may sometimes sacrifice your own needs to maintain harmony in your relationships, which can lead to resentment if not balanced with healthy self-advocacy. Your ideal partner appreciates your gentle nature without exploiting it, and contributes equally to the emotional labor of the relationship. Family life is a source of deep satisfaction, and you create a home environment that is warm, welcoming, and spiritually nourishing.

Health-wise, Revati governs the feet, ankles, and the lymphatic system. You may be prone to conditions affecting the feet (corns, bunions, infections), ankle weakness, and lymphatic congestion. Your constitution is sensitive and responsive to environmental influences, and you may absorb the emotional states of those around you, making energetic boundaries and regular cleansing practices important for your well-being. Time spent near water—the ocean, rivers, or lakes—has a particularly restorative effect on your health and spirits. As the nakshatra of completion, your greatest health asset is the ability to let go of what no longer serves you, making each ending a doorway to renewed vitality and purpose.`

    `Born on Shukla Dashami (the tenth day of the waxing Moon), you carry the victorious energy of this auspicious tithi, which is associated with the triumph of dharma over adharma.

You possess charm, creativity, and a natural magnetism that attracts both romantic attention and creative opportunities. Your personality combines aesthetic refinement with a practical understanding of how desire motivates human behavior, making you effective in fields that involve persuasion, marketing, entertainment, or the arts.

    `Born on Shukla Chaturdashi (the fourteenth day of the waxing Moon), you carry the intense, purifying energy of this tithi, which is associated with Lord Shiva in his fierce Rudra aspect. This is a powerful but challenging tithi, bestowing upon you intensity, spiritual depth, and the capacity for radical transformation. You may experience periods of destruction or upheaval in your life that, while painful, ultimately clear away what is false or outworn, making space for authentic expression and spiritual growth. Your personality is uncompromising in its pursuit of truth, and you have little patience for hypocrisy, pretension, or superficiality.

You are emotionally expressive, socially gifted, and often found at the center of social gatherings and cultural events. Your creative abilities are at their peak, and you have a natural talent for performing arts, public speaking, and any form of self-expression that benefits from an audience. However, the intensity of Full Moon energy can also create emotional volatility, heightened sensitivity, and a tendency toward excess. Career paths in the arts, entertainment, public relations, hospitality, counseling, and any field that rewards emotional intelligence and public-facing charisma are strongly favored. In relationships, you are passionate, generous, and deeply romantic, seeking a partner who appreciates your emotional depth and matches your capacity for grand gestures of love and devotion.`,

  // Krishna Paksha (Waning Moon)
  'Krishna Pratipada':
    `Born on Krishna Pratipada (the first day of the waning Moon), you possess a reflective, introspective personality that naturally gravitates toward contemplation, evaluation, and the integration of experience. While Shukla Pratipada initiates new ventures with outward energy, Krishna Pratipada turns the focus inward, beginning the process of absorption, understanding, and refinement. You are a natural evaluator and critic who can assess the quality and meaning of experiences, projects, and relationships with discerning clarity. Your personality combines practical wisdom with philosophical depth, and you are often sought out for your honest, thoughtful assessments. Career paths in criticism, quality assurance, editing, consulting, auditing, and any field that requires the ability to evaluate and improve existing structures or works are well suited to your nature. In relationships, you bring a mature, reflective energy that values depth of understanding over the excitement of novelty.`,

  'Krishna Dwitiya':
    `Born on Krishna Dwitiya (the second day of the waning Moon), you possess a balancing, harmonizing energy that helps you navigate the transitions and adjustments that life inevitably requires. This tithi carries the energy of graceful adaptation and the wisdom to know when to hold on and when to let go. You have a natural talent for diplomacy and mediation, particularly in situations where others are struggling with loss, change, or the need to release attachments. Your personality is calm, steady, and reassuring, and you provide stability for those around you during turbulent times. Career paths in counseling, social work, transition coaching, estate management, mediation, and any field that involves helping others navigate change and loss with grace are strongly indicated. In relationships, you bring emotional maturity and the ability to maintain equilibrium through the natural ups and downs of partnership, making you a deeply reliable and comforting companion.`,

  'Krishna Tritiya':
    `Born on Krishna Tritiya (the third day of the waning Moon), you carry a creative energy that is directed toward refinement, editing, and the perfection of existing works rather than the creation of entirely new ones. While the Shukla phase emphasizes creation and expansion, the Krishna phase emphasizes curation, distillation, and the extraction of essential meaning. You possess excellent critical faculties and the ability to distinguish between what is valuable and what is merely ornamental. Your artistic sensibility tends toward elegance and simplicity rather than excess and elaboration. Career paths in editing, curation, restoration, conservation, specialized craftsmanship, and any field that involves refining or preserving valuable works are well suited to your talents. In relationships, you value quality over quantity, preferring a small circle of deep, meaningful connections to a large network of superficial acquaintances.`,

  'Krishna Chaturthi':
    `Born on Krishna Chaturthi (the fourth day of the waning Moon), you possess a determined, resilient personality that is particularly adept at removing obstacles through patience, analysis, and strategic persistence. Lord Ganesha's energy influences this tithi as it does Shukla Chaturthi, but here the obstacle-removing quality is directed toward clearing away internal barriers—limiting beliefs, unproductive habits, and attachments that no longer serve your growth. You have a natural talent for troubleshooting, debugging, and identifying the root causes of problems that others have given up trying to solve. Your practical intelligence is formidable, and you approach challenges with a systematic methodology that eventually yields solutions. Career paths in engineering, IT troubleshooting, mechanical repair, problem-solving consulting, and any field that requires diagnostic skill and persistent analysis are well indicated. In relationships, you are patient and dedicated, willing to work through difficulties rather than abandoning ship at the first sign of trouble.`,

  'Krishna Panchami':
    `Born on Krishna Panchami (the fifth day of the waning Moon), you possess a contemplative, scholarly energy that is directed toward deep understanding rather than broad acquisition of knowledge. While Shukla Panchami emphasizes the expansion of learning, Krishna Panchami emphasizes the internalization and mastery of what has already been learned. You are drawn to specialization and depth, preferring to become truly expert in a narrow field rather than superficially familiar with many subjects. Your intellectual temperament is meditative, patient, and thorough, and you produce your best work when given the time and space for deep contemplation. Career paths in specialized research, academic scholarship, contemplative writing, meditation teaching, and any field that rewards deep expertise over broad familiarity are strongly indicated. In relationships, you value intellectual intimacy and the kind of understanding that develops through years of shared experience and mutual exploration of ideas.`,

  'Krishna Shashthi':
    `Born on Krishna Shashthi (the sixth day of the waning Moon), you possess a protective, strategic energy that is expressed through careful planning, risk assessment, and the anticipation of threats before they materialize. While Shukla Shashthi emphasizes active combat and aggressive defense, Krishna Shashthi emphasizes strategic withdrawal, defensive positioning, and the conservation of resources for decisive moments. You have a talent for reading situations accurately and knowing when to act and when to wait, when to advance and when to retreat. This makes you effective in competitive environments where strategic patience and timing are as important as raw courage. Career paths in strategic planning, security consulting, insurance, risk management, defensive medicine, and any field that involves protecting assets and anticipating threats are well suited to your talents. In relationships, you are cautiously devoted, building trust gradually and protecting your emotional investments with careful attention.`,

  'Krishna Saptami':
    `Born on Krishna Saptami (the seventh day of the waning Moon), you carry a reflective solar energy that turns the Sun's outward radiance inward, creating a personality that is self-aware, contemplative, and drawn to understanding the inner dimensions of consciousness. You possess the Sun's natural authority and dignity, but you express these qualities in a quieter, more understated way than those born during the Shukla phase. Your leadership style is lead-by-example rather than lead-by-command, and you prefer to influence through the quality of your character rather than through overt displays of power. Career paths in mentoring, spiritual counseling, contemplative arts, writing, and any field that involves guiding others through inner work and self-discovery are strongly indicated. In relationships, you bring a mature, self-aware presence that enriches your partnerships with depth, authenticity, and a genuine understanding of both your own and your partner's inner landscape.`,

  'Krishna Ashtami':
    `Born on Krishna Ashtami (the eighth day of the waning Moon), you carry a deeply transformative energy that is particularly suited for inner work, psychological exploration, and the facing of shadow aspects of the self. Krishna Ashtami is associated with Lord Krishna's birth (Janmashtami falls on this tithi), and you share the divine avatar's capacity for navigating darkness with grace, wisdom, and ultimate triumph. Your life may involve significant passages through difficulty and darkness, but these experiences develop within you a compassion, wisdom, and resilience that become your greatest gifts. You possess psychological depth and the ability to help others face their own shadows and fears. Career paths in psychology, depth counseling, hospice care, transformative healing, mystical arts, and any field involving the navigation of darkness toward light are well indicated. In relationships, you are deeply loyal and capable of standing by your partner through their darkest moments, offering the same courage and compassion that you have developed through your own challenging experiences.`,

  'Krishna Navami':
    `Born on Krishna Navami (the ninth day of the waning Moon), you possess a fierce, protective energy that is directed inward, toward the defense and strengthening of your inner life, values, and spiritual convictions. While Shukla Navami emphasizes the outward fight against injustice, Krishna Navami emphasizes the inner battle against one's own weaknesses, doubts, and destructive tendencies. You are a spiritual warrior who understands that the most important battles are fought within the mind and heart. Your personality combines strength with introspection, creating a character that is both formidable and deeply self-aware. Career paths in spiritual practice, martial arts instruction, addiction counseling, inner-child healing, contemplative psychology, and any field that involves helping others overcome their internal obstacles are well suited to your nature. In relationships, you seek a partner who is engaged in their own process of inner growth and who can serve as both companion and fellow warrior on the path of self-transformation.`,

  'Krishna Dashami':
    `Born on Krishna Dashami (the tenth day of the waning Moon), you carry a victorious energy that is expressed through the quiet triumph of inner mastery rather than outward conquest. While Shukla Dashami celebrates visible victories over external enemies, Krishna Dashami celebrates the subtler victory of self-discipline, detachment, and the transcendence of ego-driven desires. You possess excellent judgment, moral integrity, and the ability to make decisions that prioritize long-term well-being over short-term satisfaction. Your personality is dignified, measured, and deeply principled, and you are respected for your consistency and reliability. Career paths in judiciary, ethics, compliance, monastic administration, and any field that requires the exercise of sound judgment and principled decision-making under pressure are strongly indicated. In relationships, you are steadfast and trustworthy, building partnerships on a foundation of shared values, mutual respect, and the quiet confidence that comes from knowing who you are and what you stand for.`,

  'Krishna Ekadashi':
    `Born on Krishna Ekadashi (the eleventh day of the waning Moon), you possess a deeply spiritual personality with a natural affinity for ascetic practices, detachment, and the purification of consciousness. Krishna Ekadashi is considered among the most powerful tithis for spiritual practice, and those born on it carry an inherent understanding that true fulfillment comes not from the acquisition of worldly goods but from the cultivation of inner peace, devotion, and wisdom. You have a natural capacity for self-discipline and renunciation that serves you well in both spiritual and worldly pursuits. Your simplicity of character and sincerity of purpose inspire trust and respect in others. Career paths in spiritual teaching, yoga instruction, naturopathy, fasting and cleansing therapy, charitable administration, and any field that involves helping others simplify their lives and connect with deeper sources of meaning are strongly indicated. In relationships, you seek a partner who shares your spiritual values and supports your contemplative practices, creating a partnership that nurtures the soul as well as the heart.`,

  'Krishna Dwadashi':
    `Born on Krishna Dwadashi (the twelfth day of the waning Moon), you carry a compassionate, service-oriented energy that finds its highest expression in selfless giving and the care of those in need. While Shukla Dwadashi emphasizes the organization and distribution of resources, Krishna Dwadashi emphasizes the surrender of personal attachment to those resources and the realization that true wealth lies in what you give away rather than what you accumulate. You possess a generous spirit, a practical competence in managing resources, and a philosophical perspective that allows you to hold material possessions lightly. Career paths in non-profit management, charitable work, hospice care, elder care, philanthropic advising, and any field that involves the compassionate distribution of resources to those in need are well suited to your nature. In relationships, you are selflessly devoted, sometimes to a fault, and learning to receive as well as give is an important developmental theme for you.`,

  'Krishna Trayodashi':
    `Born on Krishna Trayodashi (the thirteenth day of the waning Moon), you carry the energy of Shiva's grace and the dissolution of attachments that bind the soul. This tithi, associated with Pradosh, brings the blessing of Lord Shiva's compassion during the twilight hour, and you possess a natural understanding of the beauty and necessity of letting go. Your personality combines sensitivity with philosophical detachment, allowing you to appreciate life's pleasures without becoming enslaved by them. You have a talent for helping others release what no longer serves them—old grievances, outdated beliefs, toxic relationships, or accumulated clutter. Career paths in decluttering and organization consulting, grief counseling, divorce mediation, environmental cleanup, estate clearing, and any field that involves the graceful management of endings and transitions are strongly indicated. In relationships, you bring a philosophical acceptance and grace that helps both you and your partner navigate the inevitable changes and losses that partnership entails.`,

  'Krishna Chaturdashi':
    `Born on Krishna Chaturdashi (the fourteenth day of the waning Moon), you carry the intense, purifying energy of the penultimate dark lunar day, associated with Lord Shiva in his most fierce and transformative aspect. This is the darkest night before Amavasya, and those born on it possess the courage to face the deepest shadows of existence without flinching. Your personality is intense, uncompromising in its pursuit of truth, and capable of perceiving realities that others find too frightening to acknowledge. You are a natural destroyer of illusions, and your presence often catalyzes deep transformation in those around you. Career paths in crisis intervention, trauma therapy, investigative journalism, forensic work, demolition, and any field that involves confronting darkness and extracting truth from concealment are well suited to your nature. In relationships, you are fiercely loyal and absolutely honest, expecting the same raw authenticity from your partner. Superficiality has no place in your intimate life.`,

  'Krishna Amavasya':
    `Born on Krishna Amavasya (the New Moon or dark Moon), you possess a profound, mysterious, and deeply intuitive personality that draws its power from the hidden, unconscious dimensions of existence. Amavasya represents the complete absence of visible moonlight, symbolizing the dark womb of creation from which all things emerge. Far from being inauspicious, this tithi bestows upon you a unique connection to the unseen world—dreams, intuition, ancestral memory, and the collective unconscious. You possess psychic sensitivity and the ability to access information and insights that are unavailable to those who rely solely on rational, daylight consciousness. Your personality may appear reserved or enigmatic to others, but beneath the surface lies a rich inner world of extraordinary depth and creative potential. Career paths in psychology, dream work, astrology, occult sciences, underground resources, night-shift professions, research, and any field that involves working with hidden or invisible forces are strongly indicated. In relationships, you are deeply bonded and emotionally intense, seeking a partner who can accept your mysterious nature and share in the profound intimacy that comes from exploring the hidden dimensions of life together. Your greatest gift is the ability to find treasure in the darkness that others fear to enter.`
