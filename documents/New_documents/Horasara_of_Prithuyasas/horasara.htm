<h2><a name=1>Ch. 1. R&#257;&#347;i Vibhaga</a></h2>

<p>There flourishes the divine S&#363;rya, the lord of the day,
who is the sole cause and the soul of the Universe, who
illumines all the worlds, and who daily brings Creation,
Destruction and Protection.</p>

<p>The time measured from a second (required for winking the eye
once) up to a year and the duration of each (zodiacal)
R&#257;&#347;i have been explained along with astronomical
calculations and characteristics of the Grahas.</p>

<p>In the section of Horoscopy the various Dasha divisions have
been dealt with. But those with lesser understanding capacity
need more scientific explanation, as they cannot grasp all (from
Brihat Jataka).</p>

<p>Notes. This implies, that the present work has simplified
explanations based on Brihat Jataka. Further additions are made
by the author so an average student can grasp more.</p>

<p>In order, that the effects, which were declared by the old
masters, who were able to predict the future accurately, are
clarified lucidly, I shall state the gist of the ocean of Horary
Science.</p>

<p>The names of the twelve R&#257;&#347;is are Mesh, Vrishabh,
Mithun, Kark, Simh, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbh
and Meen in their order.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;i Kanya is described, as a virgin seated in
a boat with fire and corn in her hands. Tula is represented by a
man holding scales (balance), while Meen resembles a pair of
fish. The R&#257;&#347;i Makar is a deer-faced crocodile, while
Dhanu looks like a man holding a bow and having a hip, like that
of a horse. The R&#257;&#347;is Mesh, Vrishabh, Simh, Kark and
Vrischik, respectively, have the forms of a ram, ox, lion, crab
and scorpion, true to their (Sanskrit) names. Mithun is imagined
to be a combination of a male and a female (a couple) holding a
staff and lute, respectively.</p>

<p>Vrischik, Meen, Makar and Kark are watery R&#257;&#347;is.
Tula, Kumbh, Vrishabh and Kanya are water resorter
R&#257;&#347;is. Remaining R&#257;&#347;is are land resorters.
Simh’s abode is mountain’s caves. The habitations for Mesh,
Tula, Mithun and Dhanu are in their order plateau, city, village
and warfield.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;is Kark, Vrischik and Meen are reptile
R&#257;&#347;is, especially Vrischik, the scorpion
R&#257;&#347;i.  Quadruped R&#257;&#347;is are the second half
of Dhanu, the first half of Makar, the whole portions of Mesh,
Vrishabh and Simh. Biped, or human R&#257;&#347;is are Kumbh,
Mithun, Tula, Kanya and the first 15 degrees of Dhanu.</p>

<p>The biped R&#257;&#347;is are strong, when they house Lagn.
Similarly strong are the quadruped R&#257;&#347;is holding Karm
Bhava, the reptile R&#257;&#347;is having Yuvati and the watery
R&#257;&#347;is, if resided by Bandhu.</p>

<p>Two and a quarter of Nakshatras make one Rasi.  Each of the
12 R&#257;&#347;is is constituted by two and quarter of
Nakshatras, or nine quarters with Ashvini in the start in Mesh
and Revati at the end in Meen.</p>

<p>One Ghatik each at the junctions of Revati-Ashvini,
Aslesha-Magha and Jyeshtha-Mul is called Gandantha. This evil
period rules for four years; some say for six years.</p>

<p>Notes: According to Kasinatha’s Lagnacandrika the first three
Ghatis of Mul, Magha and Ashvini are cal]ed Ganda Nadika.
Simi]ar]y the ending five Ghatis of each of Jyeshtha, Aslesha
and Revati.  Donation of ghee filled bronze vessel, black cow
and gold are suggested to overcome the evil of this Gandanadika.
(See Slokas 89-92 of Ch. I of Lagnacandrika) Saravali simply
says, that the ending portions of Kark, Meen and Vrischik are
called Gandantha. Also see Phala Deepika Ch. I, Sloka 4, which
calls such portion, as Bhasandhi. For more information, please
see Balabhadra’sHoraRatna, Ch.II. The effects of Gandantha may
be seen in Ch. V. of the present work.</p>

<p>The first Navamshas of the 12 Rasis from Mesh onwards are,
respectively, Mesh, Makar, Tula and Kark, repeating again twice.
The rulers of the Navamshas are the same, as the R&#257;&#347;i
lords. The Dwadashamshas begin from the same R&#257;&#347;i. The
lords of Dreshkanas for each R&#257;&#347;i are in their
respective order: the lord of the same R&#257;&#347;i, the
5<sup>th</sup> lord there of and the 9<sup>th</sup> lord there
of.</p>

<p>The Trimshamsh degrees allotted to Mangal, &#346;ani, Guru,
Budh and &#346;ukr are 5, 5, 8, 7 and 5, respectively, in odd
R&#257;&#347;is. The reverse is true in even R&#257;&#347;is,
(i.e. 5, 7, 8, 5 and 5, respectively).</p>

<p>Notes. The division of Trimshamsh will be more useful to
assess the disposition of a female, her luck etc. These have
been elaborately dealt with in Ch. 25.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;is Mesh, Vrishabh, Dhanu, Makar and Kark
ascend with hinder part and are known to be strong between
sunset and sunrise. The R&#257;&#347;i Meen rises with its face
in opposite direction (in both ways) and is strong in twilight
and the rest without Mithun rise with their heads and are strong
during the day. All the R&#257;&#347;is are strong, if they
recveive a drsihti from their own lords, or from Budh, or from
Guru.</p>

<p>Notes: Brihat Jataka says, that Kark is a day R&#257;&#347;i
and Mithun is a night R&#257;&#347;i. Also see Sloka 14 of Ch. I
of Jataka Parijata and Sloka 13, Ch. 7 of Sanketa Nidhi for
details of night R&#257;&#347;is and day R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>The 12 R&#257;&#347;is follow classified, as male and female
one after the other. These are also known, as movable, fixed and
dual R&#257;&#347;is in their respective order, thus repeated
four times from Mesh onward.</p>

<p>Notes: The R&#257;&#347;is Mesh, Mithun, Simh, Tula, Dhanu
and Kumbh are male. The rest are female. Mesh, Kark, Tula and
Makar are movable R&#257;&#347;is. Vrishabh, Simh, Vrischik and
Kumbh are fixed R&#257;&#347;is. The rest are dual
R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;i Mesh and its Konas are Kshatriyas. Brahmin
R&#257;&#347;is are Kark and its Konas. Mithun and its Konas are
Vaisyas. Vrishabh and its Konas are Sudras.</p>

<p>Notes: The 5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> form a
R&#257;&#347;i are called its Konas. The Kshatriya
R&#257;&#347;is are:  Mesh, Simh and Dhanu. Brahmin
R&#257;&#347;is are: Kark, Vrischik and Meen.  Vaisya
R&#257;&#347;is are: Mithun, Tula and Kumbh. Sudra
R&#257;&#347;is are:  Vrishabh, Kanya and Makar. These divisions
can be used profitably in Prashn, also.</p>

<p>Face, neck, arms, heart, stomach, (waist/hips), groins,
private parts, thighs, knees, shanks and feet are, respectively,
assigned to the twelve R&#257;&#347;is commencing from Mesh.</p>

<p>For a native, the twelve limbs mentioned above are to be
counted from Lagn onwards.</p>

<p>The following 12 colours are assigned to the 12
R&#257;&#347;is in their order: red, white, green, pink, brown,
grey, variegated, black, golden, yellow, variegated and thick
brown.</p>

<p>Meen and Mesh are of short ascension.  Crooked are Vrishabh
and Kumbh. Long ascension R&#257;&#347;is are Makar, Mithun,
Kark and Dhanu. The rest are of medium length.</p>

<p>Notes: These can be used particularly to assess the form of a
person. If he has Makar on the second house, his face will be
long. Suppose Meen, or Mesh ascends, the person will be short
statured.</p>

<p>The following are 12 different names given to the 12
R&#257;&#347;is commencing from Mesh: Kriya, Tavuru, Jituma,
Kulira, Leya, Pathona, Juka, Kaurpi, Taukshika, Akokera,
Hridroga and Cheththa.</p>

<p>Scholars have given various names to Mesh etc. Among them,
“Ali” indicates Vrischik, while “Vanagiri” Simh.</p>

<p>The twelve Bhavas from Lagn are, respectively, called as:
Tanu, Dhan (Artha), Sahaj, Bandhu, Putr, Ari, Yuvati (Kalatra),
Randhr (Nidhana), Dharm, Karm (Kriya), Labh (Aya) and Vyaya
(Vigama).</p>

<p>Notes: The meanings of the 12 synonyms given above are: body,
wealth, co-born, relatives, children, enemies, wife, death,
righteousness, or good work (one of the four ends of human
existence), action, income and loss. Vigama apart from meaning
loss, also means death, or departure. The 12<sup>th</sup> being
the terminal house of the horoscope is related to one’s
departure from the world.</p>

<p>Kendr, Panaphara and Apoklima divide the 12 houses in three
groups. Kendras are Tanu, Bandhu, Yuvati and Karm Bhava. Dhan,
Putr, Randhr and Labh Bhava are called Panapharas. The Apoklimas
are Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya Bhavas.</p>

<p>Notes: Panapharas are the next Bhavas to Kendras, while
Apoklimas are the next ones to Panapharas.</p>

<p>Kantaka and Chatushtaya are the other names given to Kendras
(angles), while Charama means Apoklima. Madhya Kendr is
Panaphara.</p>

<p>Bandhu and Randhr Bhava are known, as Chaturasra. Ari and
Labh Bhava are otherwise called Shatkona. Sahaj, Ari, Karm and
Labh Bhava are known, as Upachayas.</p>

<p>Alternative names given to Yuvati Bhava are: Jamitra, Asta
Bhavana, Dyuna, Kama and Chitha. Sahaj Bhava is called
Duschikya, Sahaj and Vikrama.</p>

<p>Aspada (place), Ajna (command), Karma (livelihood), Meshurana
and Kha-Madhya (zenith point of the firmament) are all identical
with Karm Bhava. Bandhu Bhava is called Hibuka, Sukh
(happiness), Vesma (residence), Pathala (underworld), Vari
(water) and Bandhu (relatives).</p>

<p>Trikon, or Kon notes Putr and Dharm Bhava, while Tritrikon
(Kon of the Kon) indicates Dharm Bhava only. The other names
given to Dharm Bhava are: Bhagya, Guru and Subh.</p>

<p>Notes. According to some Jyotishis, Lagn is also to be
considered, as a Kon, apart from being a Kendr. However, Phala
Deepika Ch I, Sloka 17 and 18 list 1, 4, 7 and 10, as Kendras
and specifically mention, that the 5<sup>th</sup> and the
9<sup>th</sup> are Konas. Same view is found in Brihat Jataka
(Ch. I), Saravali (Ch. I, Sloka 27, Lagnachandika (Ch.  I, Sloka
6), Jataka Tatwa (Ch. I, Rule 27 and Jataka Parijata (Ch. I).
Thus from these references, only the 5<sup>th</sup> and the
9<sup>th</sup> are called Konas and Tanu Bhava is not.</p>

<p>Vyaya Bhava is called, as Rippha, Lopa (void) and Vyaya
(loss), while Dhan Bhava is termed, as Vitta (wealth), Kutumba
(family), Vak (speech) and Mangala (auspiciousness).</p>

<p>Randhr Nidhana (death), Vinasa (destruction) and Dukh (grief)
are the other identifications of Randhr Bhava.  All the names
Riksha, Bhava, Kshetra, R&#257;&#347;i mean one and the same
thing.</p>

<p>Notes. Bhav also means R&#257;&#347;i (Brihat Jataka, Ch. I,
Sloka 6).</p>

<p>Udaya (rising), Prag Lagn (the point rising in the east),
Lekha and Hora are the other names given to Lagn. The various
names, as enumerated for the R&#257;&#347;is are given by the
ancient preceptors.</p>

<p>Hora means also half of a R&#257;&#347;i.  Lalata Rekh. (the
1ine on the forehead, or Brahma Lipi) also indicates Hora.  Some
Jyotishis depend on the Hora for the knowledge of future.</p>

<p>Notes: The word Kal indicates the present, past and future,
as known by Trikala.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 1<sup>st</sup> Ch. entitled R&#257;&#347;i
Vibhaga in Hor&#257;shara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=2>Ch. 2. Grah Lakshanas</a></h2>

<p>The lords of the 12 R&#257;&#347;is and that of the 12
Navamashas with the same identity are: Mangal, &#346;ukr, Budh,
Candr, S&#363;rya, Budh, &#346;ukr, Mangal, Guru, &#346;ani,
&#346;ani and Guru. The lords of the Horas in odd
R&#257;&#347;is are S&#363;rya and Candr, while the reverse is
true in the case of even R&#257;&#347;is. The lords of the four
directions, viz. East, South, West and North are Mesh, Vrishabh,
Mithun and Kark, respectively, with their Konas repeating again
in the same order.</p>

<p>Notes: Each R&#257;&#347;i is divided in two equal parts of
15 degrees. The first 15 degrees of odd R&#257;&#347;is are
ruled by S&#363;rya and called Solar half. The second 15 degrees
are ruled by Candr and called Lunar half. In the case of even
R&#257;&#347;i, the arrangement is reversed. As regards
directions, these are clear for R&#257;&#347;is. See planetary
rulerships of the directions, as under:  S&#363;rya, &#346;ani,
&#346;ukr, Candr, Mangal, Budh, Rahu, Guru; East, West, South
East, North West, South, North, South West and North East,
respectively, (as per Brihat Jataka, Ch. II, Sloka 6 and my
English translation of Saravali).</p>

<p>These can be profitably used in Horary Astrology also. In
this context, C. G. Rajan’s Tamil translation of Parasara Hora
and Prasna Marga, Slokas 7 to 9 in Ch. II have the following
account:  Mesh-Vrishabh East, Kark-Simh South, Tula-Vrischik
West, Kumbh-Meen North, Mithun South East, Kanya South East,
Dhanu North West, Meen North East.</p>

<p>The exaltation Bhavas for the (seven) Grahas from S&#363;rya
onwards are: Mesh, Vrishabh, Makar, Kanya, Kark, Meen and Tula.
In these Bhavas, the respective Grahas have the highest
exaltation points at 10<sup>th</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>,
28<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>,
27<sup>th</sup> and the 20<sup>th</sup> degrees. The seventh
R&#257;&#347;i from the exaltation R&#257;&#347;i is the
R&#257;&#347;i of fall, or depression for the respective Grah
and similar degree is the point of deepest fall.</p>

<p>Notes: These can be tabulated thus: (Grah, Deep exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i and degree, Deep fall R&#257;&#347;i and degree);
S&#363;rya, Mesh, 10, Tula, 10; Candr, Vrishabh, 3, Vrischik, 3;
Mangal, Makar, 28, Kark, 28; Budh, Kanya, 15, Meen, 15; Guru,
Kark, 5, Makar, 5; &#346;ukr, Meen, 27, Kanya, 27; &#346;ani,
Tula, 20, Mesh, 20.</p>

<p>For Rahu and Ketu, please see notes Sloka 8 of this Ch..</p>

<p>In Kanya, the portion of 5 degrees following the exaltation
zone (i. e. from 15 1’ to 20”) is Multrikon for Budh and from 20
degrees onwards it is to be treated, as his Swakshetr. Thus it
has a triple role for Budh.</p>

<p>The first three degrees of Vrishabh are Candr’s exaltation
portion, while the rest is her Multrikon. For &#346;ukr up to 20
degrees in Tula are her Multrikon and the rest is her own Bhava,
(i.e.  Swakshetr).</p>

<p>The first twenty degrees of Simh is S&#363;rya’s Multrikon.
The remaining portion is his own Bhava. &#346;ani has the same
arrangement in the R&#257;&#347;i Kumbh, as S&#363;rya has in
Simh.</p>

<p>It is Multrikon upto twelve degrees in Mesh for Mangal, while
rest is his Swakshetr. For Guru, the first five degrees in Dhanu
are Multrikon and the rest is Swakshetr.</p>

<p>Notes: Readers are referred to Saravali (Ch. 3) for
Multrikon, Swakshetr, Deep exaltation etc.</p>

<p>As Rahu, Ketu have not been dealt with, I give below some
information in this regard: Vriddha Samhita and Jyotishamrita
state, that Kumbh and Vrischik are owned by Rahu and Ketu in
their order.  Veemesaram, a Tamil work calls Kumbh, as Rahu’s
own Bhava, but nothing is allotted to Ketu. Both are exalted in
Vrischik and are in fall in Vrishabh, as per Jatakalankaram
(Tamil) and Veemesaram. Jatakachintamani agrees with this, only
for Rahu, while it mentions, that Ketu is exalted in Mithun and
is in fall in Dhanu. Syama Sangraham says, that Mithun and Dhanu
are exaltation and Neech for Rahu and the reverse is true for
Ketu. Sarvartha Chintamani gives Vrishabh-Vrischik, as
exaltation and debilitation for Rahu and Vrischik Vrishabh, as
exaltation and debilitation for Ketu. Bhavartha Ratnakara
states, that Rahu is exalted in Vrishabh and Ketu in Vrischik
and Rahu has Mithun and Kark, as his Multrikonas, while Ketu’s
Multrikonas are Dhanu and Makar. Also see Uttara Kalamrita,
Slokas 19-20 of Ch. IV, for more information. There are, thus,
varied views in this regard.</p>

<p>Take the Multrikon Bhava of a Grah. The lords of the
3<sup>rd</sup>, the 6<sup>th</sup>, the 7<sup>th</sup>, the
10<sup>th</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup> from that Bhava are
inimical to that Grah. This rule does not apply, if the said
Bhava happens to be the exaltation Bhava. The rulers of other
Bhavas than the ones mentioned above are friendly. There are
three kinds of relationships of Grahas, viz. friendly, inimical
and neutral.</p>

<p>Notes: For example, Mangal has his Multrikon in Mesh. The
10<sup>th</sup> from there is his exaltation Bhava.  Hence,
&#346;ani is neutral to Mangal. Also see Phala Deepika, Ch. 2,
Sloka 21.</p>

<p>There is temporary friendship between Grahas, if they are
mutually in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 11<sup>th</sup>, or the
12<sup>th</sup> and the 2<sup>nd</sup>, or the 4<sup>th</sup>
and the 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>The eight quarters commencing from the East are serially
lorded by S&#363;rya, &#346;ukr, Mangal, Rahu, &#346;ani, Candr,
Budh and Guru. These quarters have strength at all times.</p>

<p>Notes: See note given under Sloka 2 of Ch.  II for details of
directions with reference to R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>The Grahas cast full Drishti on the 7<sup>th</sup> from their
position. The Drishti is 3/4<sup>th</sup> on the 4<sup>th</sup>
and the 8<sup>th</sup> Bhavas. It is only half on the
5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> Bhavas. A quarter glance
is made on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 10<sup>th</sup> Bhavas.
From S&#363;rya onwards, the Grahas have rays thus: 20, 8, 10,
10, 12, 14 and 16. The 12 R&#257;&#347;i possess the same rays,
as their lords do.</p>

<p>Notes: Mangal has special full Drishti on the 4<sup>th</sup>
and the 8<sup>th</sup>, Guru can effectively lend full Drishti
on the 5<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup>, while &#346;ani
can give a full Drishti to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the
10<sup>th</sup> Bhavas. These are additional Drishtis allotted
to these three Grahas. For more information, refer to Ch. II of
Jataka Parijata and S. 14 of Ch. II Brihat Jataka.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya, Guru and Mangal are masculine Grahas, while Rahu,
&#346;ukr and Candr belong to female group.  &#346;ani and Budh
are eunuchs.</p>

<p>Notes: Ketu is also a eunuch, as per Phala Deepika, Ch. 2,
Sloka 27.</p>

<p>Brahmins are presided by Guru and &#346;ukr. The royal lot is
ruled by Mangal. Candr is Vaisya. Budh is of mixed breed.
&#346;ani is considered to be a Sudra (4<sup>th</sup> caste),
while Rahu is an outcaste (5<sup>th</sup> caste). Rahu,
&#346;ani, Ketu, S&#363;rya, Mangal and the dark fortnight Candr
are malefics. Budh, Guru, &#346;ukr and waxing Candr are said to
be benefics. Budh and &#346;ukr have Rajo Gun, while Guru,
S&#363;rya and Candr are Sattvic Grahas. Mangal, &#346;ani and
Rahu possess Tamo Gun. These qualities are reflected in their
actions. The following humours are peculiar to the respective
Grahas: Bile S&#363;rya and Mangal, Wind Candr and &#346;ani,
Wind Phlegm&#346;ukr and Candr, Budh has a mixture of the three
humours.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya is of dark red colour. Candr is white. Deep red is
the complexion of Mangal, while Budh is of green grass colour.
Guru is golden yellowish. &#346;ukr is whitish. &#346;ani’s
colour is blue mixed with black.</p>

<p>Mandi, the son of &#346;ani, has many colours. Rahu’s colour
is dark collyrium (blue mix). Although the R&#257;&#347;is have
pleasing colours, these are changed according to the
occupants.</p>

<p>Should a Grah be alone in its own R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh,
the effects revealed are according to its nature.  This is true,
when it does not receive a Drishti from, or is not yuti with
others. If it be in other’s Bhava, or receives a Drishti from,
or is yuti with others, the results are influenced
accordingly.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya’s body is square; his eyes are pink in colour and
he has sparse hair on his body and head. He does not live for a
long time in one place. He is of lazy disposition. His knees are
weak. He has pleasing face and delivers pleasing speech.</p>

<p>Notes: He has stout legs (Saravali).  Dasadhyayi suggests,
that these can be profitably used in regard to diseases in
Prashn: S&#363;rya causes damage to eyes, loss of hair and
thirst, fever etc.  by bilious temperament. See Phala Deepika,
Ch. II, Sloka 8, for more information.</p>

<p>Candr is tall, tender-natured, brilliant in mental
disposition, kind, skilled in policy, or politics and has mixed
humour of wind and bile. She wears white robes and ornaments.
Her body resembles a well-drawn circle. (Imagine the full Candr,
which is a perfect circle)</p>

<p>Notes: According to Phala Deepika, she has a mix of both
youth and old age. She is mainly phlegmatic. She does not have
much hair. Vide Saravali, Candr is fickleminded, phlegmatic and
rheumatic in constitution.</p>

<p>Mangal is unsteady in mind. He is capable of wounding. He has
blood-reddish eyes. He is bilious and depicted with fire and
arms. His voice is rough. His belly is depressed. He is
modest.</p>

<p>Notes: Mangal is young. He has curly and shining hair. He is
liberal. He rules marrow of the bones. (P- D- Ch. II).
According to Saravali, Mangal is short in stature, has green
eyes, ever ready for quarrels.</p>

<p>Budh’s eyes are dark. He is well-versed in politics (or in
policy-making), is of medium height, sometimes firm and
sometimes unsteady, jolly natured, in touch with all kinds of
news, witty, scholarly and has the composition mixed with the
three humours (i. e. bile, phlegm and wind).</p>

<p>Notes: See Phala Deepika, Ch. II: Sloka 11.  Budh rules skin
and is full of veins, arteries and nerves. He has an even body.
According to Dasadhyayi, he is sweet spoken, but stammering in
speech.</p>

<p>Guru has stout and tall body; his eyes are neither big nor
small, he is intelligent, well-versed in politics, or policy
making has prominent bilious composition, is a very eloquent
speaker, wears yellow apparels and jewels and is of noble
disposition.</p>

<p>Notes: Guru’s voice resembles that of a lion. He has broad
green eyes. He is mentally steady. He has a fleshy body,
(Saravali, Ch. 4). According to Dasadhyayi, he is of virtuous
disposition.</p>

<p>The body of &#346;ukr is very bright. He is fortunate, windy
and bilious in composition, broad-minded, stout bodied, has a
tendency to submit to women, has crooked eyes and is of
deceiving nature.</p>

<p>Notes: &#346;ukr has a lustrous body. He is intelligent,
broad minded, broad eyed, passionate etc. (Saravali). According
to Phala Deepika, Ch. 11, Sloka 13, &#346;ukr has stout body,
broad eyes, wind and phlegm in costitution. He has achieved
seminal growth.</p>

<p>&#346;ani has hard nails, teeth and hair.  He is deceptive.
He has long hands and feet. His constitution is bilious. He has
prominent veins, is indolent and peaceless.</p>

<p>Notes: &#346;ani is lame, has deeply depressed eyes and is
lazy. He rules muscles. He has an emaciated body. (Phala
Deepika).</p>

<p>For description of Grahas, also refer to Jataka Parijata Ch.
II.</p>

<p>Mangal resembles a boy in appearance, while Budh looks young.
The age of Guru is 30, that of &#346;ukr is 16, that of
S&#363;rya is 50 and that of Candr is 70. Rahu is 100.</p>

<p>Notes: Similar view is found in Sloka 14, Ch. II of Jataka
Parijata and in which it is additionally stated, that Ketu is
also 100. According to Phala Deepika, Mangal is 16, while Budh
is 20.</p>

<p>The general rule is, that a person acquires the nature and
appearance of the strongest Grah at the moment of birth.</p>

<p>Notes: The strongest Grah is the one, that has the highest
rupas in Shad Bal. It should be equally good in the 16 Varg
Scheme.</p>

<p>Aditya, Arka, Ravi, Bhanu, Bhaskara.  Divakara, Marthanda,
Savita, S&#363;rya, Teekshnamsu and Ina are the other names
denoting S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>Notes: As Divakara, S&#363;rya causes the day. He is
Teekshnamsu, as he has warm rays.</p>

<p>See Slokas 3 and 4 of Ch. II of Jataka Parijata for various
names given to various Grahas.</p>

<p>Sasi, Sasanka, Vidhu, Soma, Nisakara, Seethamsu, Udunatha and
Indu are synonyms of Candr.</p>

<p>Notes: Candr is Nisakara, as she causes the night. She is
Seetamsu, as her rays are cool and pleasant. The name Udunatha
is given to Candr because Candr married the 27 Nakshatras.</p>

<p>The Grah Mangal is otherwise called Aara, Vakra, Maheeja
Rudhira, Rakta, Angaraka and Krudradrik.</p>

<p>Budh’s other names are: Saumya, Vid, Jna, Somaja, Bodhana,
Kumar and Vidhusuta.</p>

<p>Notes: Budh is Candr’s son and hence known, as Somaja and
Vidhusuta.</p>

<p>Guru’s synonyms are: Jeeva, Angirasa, Suraguru, Mantri
Vachaspati, Arya, Brihaspati, Suri and Vageesh.</p>

<p>&#346;ukr is called Bhrigu, Bhrigusuta, Ahpujit, Sita,
Usanas, Vaitya Pujya, Kavya and Kavi.</p>

<p>Kona, Manda, Sani, Krishn, S&#363;rya Putr, Yama, Pangu,
Sanaischara, Sauri, Kala and Chayasuta: these are other names,
by which &#346;ani is called.</p>

<p>Rahu is indicated, as Tamas, Asura, Swarbhanu, Vidhuntuda,
Pata, Sainhikeya, Bhujanga and Ahi.</p>

<p>Ketu is called Sikhin, Dhvaja, Dhum, Mrityu Putr and
Anala.</p>

<p>These different names (as in the above s]okas) have been
given to various Grahas by the scholars of olden days.</p>

<p>Notes: Balbhadra in his Hora Ratna, quotes Suka Jataka in
this context, giving various names to Grahas, as under: (the
day), Tamohanta (destoryer of darkness), Dinakarta (cause of the
day) and Dinamani; Ratrisa, Sasi and Kumudinipathi; Kruradhrik
(inauspicious in aspect) and Krurakrit (evil doer); Prabhasuta;
S&#363;ryau and Brihaspati; Daityapujya, Kaama and Kavi;
Sanaischara, Sauri and Chayasuta; Sainhikeya, Bhujanga and
Bhujaga; course reads, as Dhumra and Anala in Balabhadra’s.</p>

<p>Please also see Sarvarthachintamani (Ch. I) and Jataka
Parijata (Ch. II) for more such information in this regard.</p>

<p>This information is supposed to help one to easily interpret
Sanskrit names, given to different Grahas in different contexts
by different texts.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 2<sup>nd</sup> Ch., entitled “Grah Lakshanas”,
in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=3>Ch. 3. Evaluation of Strengths of Grahas</a></h2>

<p>S&#363;rya has strength in his Uttarayana (northerly) course,
when he occupies his own R&#257;&#347;i, exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, Navamsh, Dreshkan, or Hora and on Sunday. In a
friendly R&#257;&#347;i, he has medium strength. He is strong in
the initial part of a R&#257;&#347;i; weak in the end and
moderately strong in the middle. He is devoid of strengh during
twilights and eclipses.</p>

<p>Notes: The Shad Bal of a Grah should essentially be
encouraging in order, that good results are achieved.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya is strong in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, in
Simh, in own Dreshkan, solar Hora, on Sunday, while in northern
declination, while entering in a R&#257;&#347;i, in the middle
portion of the day, in friendly Amshas and in Karm Bhava from
Lagn. (Jataka Parijata Ch. II)</p>

<p>Candr has strength in Vrishabh and, when in her southerly
course. She is strong in her R&#257;&#347;i, in Hora, during the
night, in her own Navamsh, on Monday and in her own Dreshkan.
She is said to possess medium strength in the first ten days of
the bright half, exceedingly strong during the next ten days and
weak during the remaining ten days. Should Candr be in the north
of the Grahas, in clockwise motion around the Grahas, yuti with,
or in Drishti to benefics, she gets strength. She is weak in the
initial portion of a R&#257;&#347;i, has medium strength in the
middle portion and is strong in the last part. The Full Candr is
strong in all R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>Notes: See Jataka Parijata, Ch. II. Candr is strong in Kark
and Vrishabh, on Monday, in her own Dreshkan and Navamsh, at the
end of a R&#257;&#347;i, when receiving a Drishti from benefics,
in Bandhu Bhava in the case of a night birth and in her
southerly course. The Full Moon, if not occupying any kind of
Sandhis (i. e. R&#257;&#347;i Sandhi, Nakshatr Sandhi, Lagn
Sandhi etc.), be strong and receiving a Drishti from other
Grahas, makes the native a king.</p>

<p>Mangal is strong, when he wins a war between Grahas, while in
retrograde motion, when brilliant (i. e. not combust), when in
Makar, Kumbh, Meen, in his southerly course, during night, in
his own Amsh, in his own R&#257;&#347;i, on Tuesday and in the
Dreshkan ruled by him.  He has full strength, when on the
meridian, or Karm Bhava. He is strong in the beginning of a
R&#257;&#347;i, weak in the middle portion and moderately strong
at the end.</p>

<p>Notes: Mangal is strong on Tuesday, in his own Amsh, in
Dreshkan Meen, Vrischik, Kumbh, Makar and Mesh, during nights,
in the south (Karm Bhava), in his retrograde motion, in the
initial portion of a R&#257;&#347;i and in Kark. (See Jataka
Parijata. Ch. Il)</p>

<p>Mangal is strong even in his enemy’s Bhava. See “Bhaumarige
Va Bali” (Uttara Kalamrita).</p>

<p>Budh regains strength, as soon as he is past the combustion
belt. He is strong in Dhanu, in Kanya and in Mithun, as
R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh and by day and night. He is also
strong in his retrograde motion except, when eclipsed by
S&#363;rya. Budh is moderately good, exceedingly strong and
weak, respectively, in the first, second and third portions of a
R&#257;&#347;i. He is strong in his own Dreshkan and in
Mithun.</p>

<p>Notes: Jatak Parijata in its Ch. II has the following in this
respect: Budh is strong in Kanya, Mithun, on Wednesday, in
Dhanu, but not joining S&#363;rya; in day and night, in his own
Vargasand in Lagn coinciding with the middle of a
R&#257;&#347;i. Guru is exceedingly strong in Dhanu, Meen, Kark,
Vrischik and during the time preceding mid day, in his northerly
course, in his own Dreshkan, in his own Amsh and, when he
succeeds in battle between Grahas. He has medium strength in the
initial part of a R&#257;&#347;i, is quite strong in the middle
and weak at the end. He is considered to be strong in retrograde
motion in all R&#257;&#347;is except in the R&#257;&#347;i
Makar, where he is in fall. Notes: Guru is strong in Meen,
Vrischik, Dhanu, Kark, own Vargas, mid-day, his northerly
declination, middle of a R&#257;&#347;i and Kumbh and he is
strong even in his fall. He gives plenty of money, if in Lagn,
or in Karm Bhava. (Jatak Parijata, Ch. II). Guru in Kumbh gives
the same results, as in Kark (Brihat Jataka, Ch. XVIII, Sloka
13) and hence is considered equally strong in Kumbh, as in
Kark.</p>

<p>While some say, that a debilitated Grah in retrograde motion
is equal to its being in exaltation, our author does not
subscribe to such view, as is evident from this Sloka.</p>

<p>&#346;ukr has strength, if he occupies Sahaj, Ari, or Vyaya
Bhava form Lagn. He is also strong, when in retrograde motion,
when ahead of S&#363;rya, during the portion of the day, that
follows mid-day, when in exaltation R&#257;&#347;i and in the
north of Grahas.  &#346;ukr has no strength in the initial
portion of a R&#257;&#347;i, but has it in the middle, while at
the end of a R&#257;&#347;i, he is only of medium strength. He
is also strong in the company of Candr, or, when victorious in
war between Grahas.</p>

<p>Notes: &#346;ukr is strong in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i,
his own Vargas, on Friday, in the middle of a R&#257;&#347;i, in
Ari, Vyaya, Sahaj, Bandhu Bhava, in the last third part of day
time, when victorious in war, whileyuti with Candr, in
retrograde motion and, while ahead of S&#363;rya. (Jataka
Parijata Ch. II).</p>

<p>&#346;ani is strong during the dark fortnight and also from
sunset to sunrise. He has strength, when in retrograde motion,
also, when in Makar, Kumbh, Tula and in southerly course.
Similar is the case with &#346;ani in the rising R&#257;&#347;i,
in his slow movement and, when successful in war between Grahas.
He is weak in the in first portion of a R&#257;&#347;i,
moderately strong in the middle portion and strong at the end.
But, some say he is strong in all places.</p>

<p>Notes: According to Jataka Parijata Ch. II, &#346;ani is
strong in Tula, his own R&#257;&#347;i, in Yuvati Bhava, in
southerly course, in own Dreshkan, on Saturday, in the end of a
R&#257;&#347;i, in war between Grahas, in the dark half and in
retrograde motion.</p>

<p>Rahu is said to be strong, when posited in Mesh, Vrishabh,
Kark, Vrischik, or Kumbh, or, when yuti with S&#363;rya, or
Candr, during Parivesh and at the end of a R&#257;&#347;i i. e.,
when he starts his journey in a R&#257;&#347;i).</p>

<p>Notes: Rahu is strong in Mesh, Kanya, Vrishabh, Vrischik and
Kumbh. He is also strong in Karm Bhava. (Jataka Parijata Ch.
II)</p>

<p>Ketu has strength in the second portion of Dhanu. He is also
strong in Meen, Kanya and Vrishabh and in night, or, when a
rainbow, or a meteor is noticed.</p>

<p>Notes: Ketu is strong in Kanya, Meen, Vrishabh and Dhanu and,
when a rainbow, or a meteor is noticed (Jatak Parijata).</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;is Mesh, Simh, Dhanu and Meen give strength
to S&#363;rya, if they happen to rise, or be on the meridian
simultaneously. In other Bhavas, he is weak.</p>

<p>Notes: Should S&#363;rya be in the said Bhavas, which happen
to be Lagn, or Karm Bhava, he is strong. In other Bhavas, as
Lagn, or Karm Bhava, he is not so good.</p>

<p>Slokas 20 to 29 deal with the strength of the Grahas ih the
various R&#257;&#347;is, which should simultaneously be that
particular Bhava in the Kundali.</p>

<p>Candr is strong, if she is in Mithun, Kanya, or Dhanu
coinciding with Lagn. She is strong in Yuvati Bhava, if it is
Meen, or the first half of Dhanu. If she is in Vrishabh, or in
the latter half of Dhanu, as Yuvati Bhava, or Karm Bhava, as the
case may be, she is strong.  Similarly, when in Kark, or in
Mithun, as Bandhu Bhava, she has strength.</p>

<p>Notes: For Kanya Lagn, Candr in Yuvati Bhava in Meen, or for
Vrischik Lagn in Vrishabh in Yuvati Bhava, for Mithun Lagn, in
Yuvati Bhava in the first half of Dhanu, for Meen in Bandhu
Bhava in Kark, is said to possess strength.</p>

<p>Mangal is strong in Lagn identical with Kumbh, or in Yuvati
Bhava, if it is Kark, or Vrischik. He is strong in Karm Bhava in
the first half of Makar, or in Mithun and in Bandhu Bhava, if in
the second half of Dhanu. He is similarly strong, when his
brightness is not obscured, or, when he is in Dharm in his own
Bhava.</p>

<p>Notes: Mangal, though in fall in Kark, is good in Yuvati
Bhava in the case of Makar natives. Should he in such a case
join &#346;ani, he blesses the subject with a beautiful and
chaste wife.  Further, Bandhu and Yuvati Bhava placement of
Mangal, as per the above Sloka shall not give rise to Kuja
dosha. For Simh and Meen Lagnas, the Grah is good in Dharm Bhava
and will not cause bad effects for the father of the native.</p>

<p>Budh is strong in Lagn, if in Makar, Simh, or Kark. He is
also strong in his own divisions. Should Dhanu hold Budh in
Bandhu Bhava, then too he is strong. Similarly in Vrishabh, as
Yuvati Bhava, or in Meen, as Karm Bhava.</p>

<p>Notes: Should Makar be Lagn and be occupied by Budh, his
blemish of Ari’s lordship is mitigated and simi]arly Vyaya’s
lordship, if in Kark Lagn. For Mithun Lagn, though he will be
fall in Karm Bhava, he will prove auspicious.</p>

<p>Guru has strength in Simh, Vrishabh, Mesh, Dhanu, Vrischik
and Meen, if one of these happens to be Lagn, or Bandhu, or Karm
Bhava of the horoscope. Otherwise he is weak.</p>

<p>Notes: Guru rules Randhr Bhava for Vrishabh Lagn. Hence, he
is adverse for longevity, if he is in Vrishabh, when it rises in
the horoscope. In such circumstances, &#346;ani should be strong
lest the native is short lived. Or otherwise, &#346;ukr should
be stronger than Guru.</p>

<p>Dr. B.V. Raman, a powerful Jyotishi has Guru in Karm Bhava in
Vrischik.</p>

<p>&#346;ukr possesses strength in Simh, Mesh.  Kumbh and
Vrischik, if these happen to be Lagn; similarly in Yuvati Bhava,
if at the end of Dhanu, or in (the whole of) Vrischik. He is
strong in the first half of Dhanu in Karm Bhava. Karm Bhava
position in Meen, Simh, or Vrischik is also good. He is strong
also in Bandhu Bhava in the second half of Makar. He is strong,
if he wins in a war between Grahas.</p>

<p>&#346;ani is strong in Kumbh, or Tula, if they happen to
rise, or be Bandhu Bhava. Similarly he is strong in Karm Bhava
in Simh, or in Yuvati Bhava in a R&#257;&#347;i, that does not
rise with hind part.</p>

<p>Notes: The risings of R&#257;&#347;is have already been
explained in the opening Ch.. Now, I give below the details of
Grahodaya, or risings of Grahas: 1) S&#363;rya, Rahu, Mangal and
&#346;ani rise with hind part and hence called Prishtodaya
Grahas. 2) Candr, &#346;ukr and Budh rise with their heads and
hence called Shirshodaya Grahas.  3) Guru rises in both ways and
hence Ubhayodaya Grah.</p>

<p>The Dasha of a Grah in that particular class of
R&#257;&#347;i will be beneficial. Suppose a Grah, that rises
with its head is in a Shirshodaya R&#257;&#347;i, then the Dasha
concerned will be auspicious.</p>

<p>&#346;ani is strong, if he is in Tula Lagn; see notes under
previous Sloka.</p>

<p>Budh and Guru in Lagn, Candr and &#346;ukr in Bandhu Bhava,
S&#363;rya and Mangal in Karm Bhava and &#346;ani in Yuvati
Bhava enjoy Dig Bal, or directional strength. According to
Yavanas, all the Grahas are devoid of strength in Apoklima
Bhavas (Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya Bhava), have medium strength
in Panaphara (Dhan, Putr, Randhr and Labh Bhava) and are strong
in Kendras (Tanu, Bandhu, Yuvati and Karm Bhava).</p>

<p>Notes: Directional strength makes a Grah confer good results
during its Dasha Bhuktis. In the opposite Bhava with reference
to such R&#257;&#347;is, the Grah has no Dig Bal. For example,
S&#363;rya has Dig Bal in Karm Bhava. Should he be in Bandhu
Bhava, his Dig Bal is nil. For full details on such
calculations, please see Dr. B. V. Raman’s Graha and Bhava
Balas, or Sripathi Paddhati, English translation by Shri V. S.
Shastry.</p>

<p>The strength of Mangal is double of &#346;ani’s. Budh is four
times stronger than Budh. Guru is eight times stronger than
Budh. &#346;ukr has eight times more strength than that of Guru.
Candr is sixteen times stronger than &#346;ukr, S&#363;rya has
twice the strength of Candr and Rahu’s strength is twice of
S&#363;rya’s and hence Rahu is the strongest of the Grahas.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and Candr be exceedingly strong, all other
Grahas, though weak, will yield good effects in their
periods.</p>

<p>Notes: The strength of S&#363;rya is the most important
factor to lend strength to the entire natus. S&#363;rya singly
in deep fall, even though other Grahas may be strong, can reduce
the vitality of Kundali. Similarly Candr’s potentiality is all
essential, as it has a notable bearing on the mind of the
person. Should Candr be in deep fall, all other Yogas become
ineffective (see Jataka Tatwa, Ch. III, Section N). And of
course, Lagn’s strength forms foundational support. Thus, these
are tripod of the horoscope.</p>

<p>&#346;ani, Guru, Mangal, S&#363;rya, &#346;ukr, Budh and
Candr: This is the order of the Grahas starting with the
distant-most one, as above (with reference to the earth). Rahu
is at the top most of earth’s orbit. Grahas are strong (i. e
more influencing in nature), if they are on the lower position
of the zodiac. Rahu is strong in the South, i. e., when he is on
the meridian of the horoscope.</p>

<p>Even, if the Grahas derive strength in the ways mentioned
earlier, they become weak, if eclipsed by S&#363;rya. Such weak
Grahas do not give good results in respect of the Bhavas, (Raja)
Yogas and Dashas they are connected with.</p>

<p>Notes: Benefic Grahas, if combust, do lose their potence,
while malefics become more mischievous. &#346;ani and &#346;ukr
are said to retain their rays even in combustion, as per Sloka
15, Ch. IV of Uttara Kalamrita.</p>

<p>Strong benefics make a person fortunate, bright and
beautiful. Malefics, when stronger than benefics, make a person
sinful and a simpleton.</p>

<p>Notes: It is to be noted, that benefic Grahas should be
stronger than malefics for Yog purposes. In any case, the
strength of malefics is equally important, as each has its own
Karakatwas; for example &#346;ani though a natural malefic
should be strong for longevity. If he is weak, the subject
cannot enjoy longevity and all Raj Yogas then will be equal to a
painting sans canvas.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 3<sup>rd</sup> Ch. entitled “Evaluation of
Strengths of Grahas” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=4>Ch. 4. Nisheka Janmadhyaya</a></h2>

<p>Should Candr in her transit pass through an Upachaya Bhava
(i.e. other than Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh Bhava) in a female’s
Kundali and come in Drishti to, or in yuti with Mangal, it leads
to her menses and is congenial for conception.</p>

<p>Notes: A girl can attain puberty, if Candr transits Lagn,
Dhan, Bandhu, Putr, Yuvati, Randhr, Dharm, or Vyaya Bhava from
her natal Lagn and receiving a Drishti from transit Mangal. A
sexual intercourse in appropriate time, as above can also lead
to conception. Candr and Mangal signify water and fire in order
and also blood and bile, respectively. Mesh indicates pituitary
glands and Vrischik rules ovum; both R&#257;&#347;is are of
Mangal. When Candr is in Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh Bhava, ovum
cannot cause conception and hence its position in Anupachaya is
indicated. A different condition for conception is, that the
same Candr should be in Sahaj, Ari, Karm, or Labh Bhava from the
Lagn and receive a Drishti from a male benefic (i.e. only Guru).
The female, should of course be in a suitable condition, as laid
down in the next Sloka.</p>

<p>In respect of women, thirteen nights after (mensural) bathing
(from the 5<sup>th</sup> day of menses through the
17<sup>th</sup> day), they become fit to conceive. This does not
apply to female children and old women (who have no menstrual
course), sickly women and barren women.</p>

<p>Notes: Sixteen nights after the menses are declared fit for
conception according to Ch. 3 of Jataka Parijata. First four
days are of course unfit, when there will be mensural flow. But
western medical researchers feel, that the week preceding a
mensural course is more effective for purpose of conception.</p>

<p>To bear an issue, the sexual intercourse should take place,
when Candr is in an Upachaya in reference to her R&#257;&#347;i
Kundali and receives a Drishti from a male benefic, or ascend
with it.</p>

<p>Notes: As per Sloka 1, the transit Candr should be in
Anupachaya from natal Lagn and be in Drishti to Mangal, while,
as per this Sloka Candr during intercourse slhould be in
Upachaya and receiving a Drishti from a male benefic, Guru.
S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr in own Navamshas and in Upachaya from
Lagn/Candr in a male’s Kundali and Candr and Mangal in own
Navamsh and in Upachaya from Lagn for a female can lead to
conception.</p>

<p>Should sexual union take place, when S&#363;rya, Candr,
&#346;ukr and Guru are in own R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamshas, it
leads to the birth of a son. Similar result occurs, if these
Grahas bare in Lagn (at the time of intercourse) and receive a
Drishti from, or are yuti with Mangal.</p>

<p>Notes: Whatever is being stated in this Ch.  is with
reference to Nisheka Lagn unless otherwise mentioned to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Should Guru be in Lagn, Putr, or Dharm Bhava, or in his own
R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh and the week day auspicious, then the
conception obtained thus becomes exemplary.</p>

<p>The under mentioned Yogas prevailing at the time of
intercourse lead to conception of a male child: a) Yuti of
Lagn’s lord and Putr’s lord; their mutual aspect, or exchange
between them; b) Strong &#346;ani in odd Bhavas other than Lagn;
c) Budh in Putr Bhava without being in yuti with of, or in
Drishti to others; d) All the male Grahas in Ari Bhava and, or
Labh Bhava, while Putr’s lord is strong; e) All Grahas in odd
R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>Notes: The involvement of an odd R&#257;&#347;i is essential,
as they are male ones, so that a male issue is obtained, vide
points b) and e) above. The conceptional Lagn, Guru, the
luminaries and &#346;ukr being strong and in an odd
R&#257;&#347;i can also lead to birth of a son. As the
conception time is difficult to be obtained, one can safely
depend upon Prashn Kundali, or Janm Kundali. Should Candr and
&#346;ukr be chiefly important, there will be birth of a
female.</p>

<p>The following combinations (at the time of intercourse) lead
to birth of a female issue: a) Candr and &#346;ukr together in
Putr, or Karm Bhava; b) Candr and &#346;ukr in their own
R&#257;&#347;is and, or Navamsh; c) Rahu rising and receiving a
Drishti from Candr, or vice versa. d) &#346;ukr in Candr’s Hora,
or in Kendr from Lagn.</p>

<p>Notes: &#346;ukr should preferably be in Vrishabh Vargas, as
it is his female R&#257;&#347;i. Tula is a male
R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>Should Budh be in a dual R&#257;&#347;i coinciding with Lagn,
or, when a dual R&#257;&#347;i is Lagn and in Drishti to Budh,
or Budh is in Karm Bhava (at the time of intercourse), birth of
twins is indicated. The sex of the children can be guessed by
the R&#257;&#347;i and Navamsh involved.</p>

<p>Notes: Budh is an important Grah in the assessment of twin
birth. And Mithun R&#257;&#347;i ascending can lead to twin
birth. Further, if S&#363;rya and Guru are posited in Dhanu, or
Mithun in any Bhava, especially, as Putr Bhava, birth of twins
is indicated. Candr and Mangal in Meen, or in Kanya receiving a
Drishti from Budh lead to the same effect. According to
Ramadayalu’s Sanketa Nidhi, Ch. 11, Sloka 3, when S&#363;rya is
in a quadruped R&#257;&#347;i and other Grahas in dual
R&#257;&#347;is with strength it indicates twin birth.</p>

<p>The following positions (at the time of intercourse)
doubtlessly lead to birth of twins: a) Both Candr and &#346;ukr
in even R&#257;&#347;is, or in dual Navamshas (in female
R&#257;&#347;is, like Vrishabh, Kark etc., or in Mithun Navamsh
and its Kendras); b) Budh in Lagn, while Mangal and Guru are in
odd R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>Notes: The first combination can lead to birth of two female
issues, as Candr and &#346;ukr are female Grahas. The latter
combination is capable of giving two male issues, as Guru and
Mangal are masculine Grahas.</p>

<p>Should Lagn and Candr be in even R&#257;&#347;is and receive
a Drishti from a strong Grah, then there are twins in the womb
(one female and one male). Similar results follow, if Candr and
&#346;ukr are in even R&#257;&#347;is, while Guru, Mangal, Budh
and Lagn are posited in odd R&#257;&#347;is, or in dual
R&#257;&#347;is and are with strength, (Slokas 21 and 22, Ch. 8
of Saravali, my English translation) Incidentally, from the said
Ch., we see below the combinations of Grahas for birth of
triplets: The following Yogas prevailing at the time of Adhana
lead to birth of triplets: a) Budh remaining in Mithun Navamsh
giving a Drishti to a Grah, who also falls in a dual Navamsh; b)
Budh remaining in Mithun Navamsh giving a Drishti to a dual
R&#257;&#347;i, which ascends; c) Budh in Kanya Navamsh giving a
Drishti to a Grah falling in dual Navamsh; d) Budh in Kanya
Navamsh giving a Drishti to a dual R&#257;&#347;i, which
ascends. e) Budh in Mithun Amsh giving a Drishti to a Grah in
Mithun Amsh, or Dhanu Amsh; f) Budh in Mithun Navamsh giving a
Drishti to Lagn, which falls in Mithun Navamsh, or in Dhanu
Navamsh; g) Budh in Yuvati Bhava giving a Drishti to a Grah in
Kanya/Meen Navamsh, or giving a Drishti to such Lagn
Navamsh.</p>

<p>Combinations a) and b) lead to birth of triplets one female
and two males. Combinations c) and d) cause birth of triplets
consisting of two females and one male. Combinations at e) and
f) cause three male children, while Combinations at g) indicate
birth of three female issues.</p>

<p>Jataka Parijata, Ch. III quotes more combinations for birth
of triplets, which the reader may consult.</p>

<p>For birth of more than three issues, here is a combination:
Dhanu Lagn in Vargothama, while all Grahas with strength being
in any R&#257;&#347;i, but in Dhanu Navamsh. The said Lagn
should, however, receive a Drishti from Budh and &#346;ani (see
Sloka 25, Ch. III, Jataka Parijata).</p>

<p>From the above, we can take a clue, that Budh and &#346;ani
are chief Grahas connected with birth of twins, triplets etc. If
one of them is strong and auspiciously posited in Putr, or Dharm
Bhava at birth, in exaltation, own Bhava and the like, then
twins etc. are to be expected. If &#346;ani is adverse, in Putr
Bhava, it is not good for issues.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and Candr be in mutual Drishti in day time
or, if Budh and &#346;ani be so in the night (during the time of
intercourse), the child born will be neither male nor
female.</p>

<p>Notes: According to Shastras, intercourse in day time is not
congenial for progeny. &#346;ani and Budh both being neuters
will only push such a child.</p>

<p>The (child-yielding) Yogas mentioned will be futile for the
couple without virility, just as the blind are devoid of many
qualities (i.e. advantages).</p>

<p>Notes: The Sloka is suggestive of the fact, that irrespective
of promising combinations of Grahas at the time of intercourse,
one should have good Putr·Bhava/Putr’s·lord. Unless the promise
for progeny is from the natal horoscope, such indications from
Adhana are of no effect.</p>

<p>During the first month of conception, the embryo will only be
in the form of ogulated blood and (the development) is ruled by
&#346;ukr. Mangal presides over the second month, while it takes
the form of a seed (like Pingaka, or Pingaksha seed). In the
third month it transforms into a sprout and is ruled by Guru;
marrow and bones are added in the 4<sup>th</sup> month ruled by
S&#363;rya; development of skin, fat and blood takes place in
the fifth month under the rulership of Candr; &#346;ani takes
over the process of growth of limbs in the sixth month; senses
occur to the child under the rulership of Budh in the seventh
month hunger and thirst are felt in the 8<sup>th</sup> month,
which process is controlled by Lagn’s lord of Nisheka (i.e. the
Grah ruling the moment of intercourse, that led to conception)
and Candr rules the ninth month, when the child develops
excitement and moves in the womb of the mother. The
10<sup>th</sup> month is ruled by S&#363;rya preceding the
delivery.</p>

<p>The foetus will progress according to the disposition of the
months concerned (i.e. the respective lords, as mentioned in
4-15 to 4-19) and the delivery of the child should be predicted
after making a thorough study of all the conditions.</p>

<p>Notes: Should the Grah concerned be afflicted in transit,
when the foetus is undergoing various developments, the
particular process is not safely taking place. For example, if
Budh is combust, be eclipsed by Rahu etc., in the fifth month,
then the child will not develop its intelligence well. Should
S&#363;rya be afflicted in the 10<sup>th</sup> month, for
example, be caught in an eclipse, the delivery may be delayed
beyond due date, or it may be very difficult, as against a
normal one (See Sloka 21).</p>

<p>Should any particular month’s lord be afflicted, or defeated
in war between Grahas, or combust in S&#363;rya, the particular
process will not progress and there may not be smooth
delivery.</p>

<p>If the Nisheka Lagn’s lord is posited in a movable
R&#257;&#347;i, the child will be born in the 10<sup>th</sup>
month; if it be in a fixed R&#257;&#347;i, the delivery will be
in the 11<sup>th</sup> month and a dual R&#257;&#347;i will
delay the delivery to the 12<sup>th</sup> month.</p>

<p>Notes: The number of days in that particular month will
depend on the degrees traversed by the said Lagn’s lord.
Suppose the Nisheka (Prashn) Lagn’s lord is in Kark 15 (a
movable R&#257;&#347;i), then delivery may take place around the
15<sup>th</sup> day in the tenth month. However, Shuka Jataka
says, that delivery shall be in the 9<sup>th</sup>, the
10<sup>th</sup>, or the 11<sup>th</sup> month, as Lagn is
movable, fixed, or dual.</p>

<p>Whatever have been described earlier in connection with
Nisheka Lagn are equally applicable to Lagn prevailing at the
time of a query (i.e. Prashn Lagn) regarding the child in the
womb. If the Prashn Lagn falls in an odd R&#257;&#347;i and is
yuti with of, or in Drishti to a male Grah, the child in the
womb is male.</p>

<p>Should the querist touch the right side of his body, or touch
another man, or utter words of masculine gender, then it can be
concluded, that the child to be born is male. Should the Prashn
Lagn receive a Drishti from, or is occupied by female Grahas, it
is a female child.</p>

<p>The following four principles may be noted:  1) Find out,
which is stronger between Lagn and Candr at the time of a query
and the related Dwadashamsh. When Candr (the month being
appropriate for delivery) transits such a R&#257;&#347;i, as
indicated by the number of Dwadashamshas, counted from that
particular Dwadashamsh position, delivery will take place. 2)
Alternatively, note the Navamsh occupied by Candr at the time of
query. Should Candr in transit reach the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava
there of, delivery may take place. 3) Delivery may also take
place, when Candr transits the Bhava of such Navamsh lord. 4)
Ascertain the fraction of the Prashn Lagn with reference to its
total duration and note whether it is a day R&#257;&#347;i, or
night R&#257;&#347;i. If it is a night R&#257;&#347;i, delivery
will take place in the day time after such a time of fraction
(past sunrise) and, if it is day R&#257;&#347;i, delivery will
take place after sunset after the lapse of such a fraction of
time. Should Bandhu’s lord be endowed with strength at the time
of query and enjoy auspicious Yogas, predict comfortable
position for the child in the womb.</p>

<p>Notes: Rule 1: Note, which is stronger, whether Lagn, or
Candr (in Nisheka, or Prashn). Suppose Lagn is stronger and in
the 7<sup>th</sup> Dwadashamsh of Mesh, i.e. between 15 00’ - 17
30’. It is in Tula Dwadashamsh. Note the possible month of
delivery, as mentioned in Sloka 22 supra. When Candr in transit
reaches Tula R&#257;&#347;i, delivery can be expected. Rule 2:
This is simple and is applicable to Prashn. Rule 3: Same, as
Rule 2. Rule 4: Instead of proceeding with fraction of duration
the Prashn Lagn has completed, we can easily proceed by the
longitude the Prashn Lagn Sphuta has obtained. Suppose the
Prashn Lagn is 3 degrees in a certain R&#257;&#347;i.  That is,
it has completed one tenth of the R&#257;&#347;i. If it is a
night R&#257;&#347;i, note the day duration on the possible day
of birth and predict birth to be after one tenth of it has
passed from sunrise. The reverse should be true for a day
R&#257;&#347;i, i.e. birth will be after one tenth of the night
following sunset. Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, Kark, Dhanu and Makar
are night R&#257;&#347;is and the rest are day R&#257;&#347;is
(Sanketa Nidhi, Ch. 7, Sloka 13). Also see my English
translation of Saravali.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 4<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Nisheka
Janmadhyaya” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=5>Ch. 5. Arishtas</a></h2>

<p>The evils to the parents and the characteristics of birth
time along with circumstances leading to (infant) death are
dealt with in this Ch..</p>

<p>The Grahas in the first six Bhavas yield good results
(directly to the native), while those in the second half of the
zodiac yield indirect results.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya and Candr represent father and mother,
respectively, of the living beings. After assessing strength and
weakness of the two Grahas predictions should be made about
parents.</p>

<p>Notes: According to Brihat Jataka, Ch. IV, Sloka 5,
S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr indicate father and mother of the
native for day birth and &#346;ani and Candr play these parts,
respectively, for night birth. The same view is expressed in
Phala Deepika (Ch. II, Sloka 22) and also in Saravali.</p>

<p>In this context, an important principle is to be noted from
Sanketa Nidhi, Ch. II, Sloka 25. Note the pair of the Grahas
concerning the father and the mother in a day birth, or night
birth, as the case may be. The effect will be full, if the birth
is in the beginning of day, or night, as the case may be; the
effects will be medium, if the birth is in middle portion and
almost little in the concluding portion. For example, a person
born in the beginning of night, or day will enjoy full results
in regard to parents, while a person born at the end of day, or
night will have little results in the same respect. (This will
also depend to an equal extent on the Grahas concerned).</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya receive Drishti from malefics and join
them, or remain in their clutches hemmed between them, then evil
is portended to the father of the child thus born.</p>

<p>If there are exclusively bad Grahas in the 6<sup>th</sup> and
the 8<sup>th</sup>, or in the 4<sup>th</sup> and the
8<sup>th</sup> from S&#363;rya, without help from benefics, then
evil is indicated to the father.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya in Mesh/Vrischik Navamsh receive a Drishti
from &#346;ani (in the R&#257;&#347;i Kundali), the elder
brother, or elder sister, or the father of the child is
extinguished.</p>

<p>Notes: S&#363;rya in Tula in Vishakah first quarter (i.e.
Mesh Navamsh) and receiving a Drishti from &#346;ani will cause
special effects in regard to father’s death. &#346;ani, or
S&#363;rya related to Labh Bhava will have a telling effect on
the elder brother, or elder sister of the native, in the
combination mentioned in the verse.</p>

<p>The child will not see its father, if Mangal is in Bandhu
Bhava, or in Dharm Bhava and falls in the Navamsh of Simh,
(Makar, or Kumbh), without receiving a Drishti from Guru, or
&#346;ukr.</p>

<p>On the same lines, through Candr, the evils to mother can be
known.</p>

<p>If Candr is waning and has only malefics in the
5<sup>th</sup>, or the 9<sup>th</sup> from her, but is without
benefic’s association, the child will be deprived of its
mother.</p>

<p>&#346;ani and Mangal in a Kendr of Candr (either jointly, or
separately) and in one Navamsh will give two mothers to the
child to live with.</p>

<p>Notes: “Two mothers” may be interpreted, as one having a
step-mother. Alternatively, he may be brought up by another
lady, who is equal to mother.</p>

<p>It is by the strength, or weakness of &#346;ani and Mangal,
that the birth takes place in the house of the father and the
mother, respectively. Should Lagn’s Lord be strong, father’s
place will be birth place.</p>

<p>Notes: It may further be noted, that, if Pitru Karak Grah is
strong, birth would have been in father’s place and, if Matru
Karak is strong, birth is in the place of the mother. Jataka
Tatwa (Vide II, B-21) says, that delivery will take place in the
house of the father, the mother, or other relatives, as
indicated by the strongest Grah.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya occupies a movable R&#257;&#347;i in
R&#257;&#347;i and in Navamsh Kundali, the father of the child
was away (at time of birth). Should S&#363;rya give a Drishti to
Lagn, it is not so. If Candr is in a similar state, the father
should be declated to have been away at the time of birth of the
child.</p>

<p>If Guru occupies his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, while Candr
is in a R&#257;&#347;i Sandhi, or Amsh Sandhi and other benefics
join malefics, the child born will be dumb and dull witted.</p>

<p>Notes: Amsh Sandhi is the end of a quarter of Nakshatr. That
is, Candr’s position should be at an area of 3 20’ (or close to
it), or multiples there of, in any R&#257;&#347;i. The
combination cited will more apply fit a Dhanu native, as Guru
will be fall in Dhan Bhava. Even, if Guru, or Budh in fall in
Dhan Bhava, while the other one of them yuti with Rahu will
cause dumbness. Should Dhan’s lord in such a case be strong and
well placed, then the defect will not come to pass. Note, that
Dhan Bhava rules one’s speech.</p>

<p>If Dharm and Bandhu Bhava have malefic occupation wlile
Lagn’s lord is weak and yuti with Mangal, or receives a Drishti
from him, the child’s father was sick at the time of its
birth.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Simh Navamsh and receives a Drishti
from S&#363;rya, the father was in a miserable state at the
tlime of the birth of the child. &#346;ani in Randhr, or Vyaya
Bhava and in Simh Navamsh simultaneously, gives the same
results.</p>

<p>The child should be declared to have been born of others’
loins, if Candr, or Lagn is without Guru’s Drishti. Should the
luminaries be yuti with malefics and receive a Drishti from
Guru, then also the same result prevails. Guru, or Candr in
mutual Vargas, or luminaries in exchange nullify these
Yogas.</p>

<p>Notes: Apart from the above two combinations, indicating
illegal birth, the following rules may be noted, as taken out
from Parashar Hora (Tamil translation by C. G. Rajan), Saravali,
Jataka Parijata and Jataka Tatwa: 1. If Candr is in Bandhu Bhava
from Lagn and receives a Drishti from malefics, or inimical
Grahas; 2. The lords of Sahaj, Ari, Dhan and Putr Bhava in Lagn
(birth through servants); 3. Malefics in Lagn, benefics in
Yuvati Bhava and &#346;ani in Karm Bhava; 4. Candr in Lagn and
Mangal with &#346;ukr in Sahaj Bhava; 5. S&#363;rya in Lagn and
Rahu in Bandhu Bhava; 6. S&#363;rya and Candr in Lagn, or
S&#363;rya and Mangal in Yuvati Bhava; 7. Lagn with Mangal and
Rahu, while S&#363;rya and Candr are in Yuvati Bhava; 8. Kendras
without Grahas; 9. All Grahas in Dhan, Ari, Randhr and Vyaya
Bhava; 10. Lords of Lagn and Yuvati Bhava together; 11.
Exchange between Lagn’s Lord and Bandhu’s lord (which should be
considered otherwise a Raj Yog); 12. Lagn, or Candr not falling
in the Vargas of Guru; 13.  Anyone group of the following,
prevailing simultaneously: a) Sunday - 2<sup>nd</sup> Tithi
Swati Nakshatr, b) Wednesday - 7<sup>th</sup> Tithi Revati, c)
Sunday - 12<sup>th</sup> Tithi Dhanishtha; 14. S&#363;rya, Candr
and Guru in fall, one of them being in Lagn; 15. Karakamsh,
related to only malefic Grahas.</p>

<p>These Yogas stand cancelled, if Kendr has a Grah, or benefics
give a Drishti to Lagn, or Candr, or Lagn’s lord in Lagn, or
Guru in Bandhu Bhava, or Mangal giving a Drishti to Guru.</p>

<p>There will be moles, or scars in the particular limb of Kala
Purush corresponding to the R&#257;&#347;i occupied by
benefics.</p>

<p>Notes: According to Jataka Muktavali, the following
combinations indicate moles, scars etc. on the body of the
native: If Yuvati Bhava from Lagn is occupied by &#346;ukr, or
Mangal, or Guru, there will be a scar on the head. &#346;ukr, or
Mangal, or Candr in Lagn leaves a mark through fire at the age
of 12. Rahu in Randhr Bhava, while &#346;ukr is in Lagn causes a
scar on the left ear. Guru in Lagn and Rahu in Yuvati Bhava
leave a scar on the left hand. &#346;ukr in Randhr, or Vyaya
Bhava and Guru in Lagn indicate marks on both the hands. If
Mangal is in Sahaj, or Ari, or Labh Bhava along with &#346;ukr,
there will be a mark on the side close to the left hand. Should
Budh, or &#346;ani be in Lagn, while S&#363;rya is in Karm Bhava
a mark on the right side should be noted. If Mangal, or Budh is
in Lagn, while Rahu is in Putr, or Ari, or Dharm Bhava, a mole
on genital organ, or anus may be found. &#346;ukr in Putr, or
Dharm Bhava, while Yuvati, or Randhr, or Bandhu Bhava is
occupied by either Guru, or Budh indicates a mark on the
stomach. Should there be &#346;ukr, or S&#363;rya in Dhan, or
Randhr Bhava, while Karm Bhava has Rahu and &#346;ani, declare a
scar on the navel. A mark on the waist may be found, if Karm
Bhava is occupied by Guru, while Candr is in Dhan Bhava and Rahu
with &#346;ukr is in Sahaj Bhava. On the anus will be found a
mark, if Vyaya Bhava has Guru, while Budh is in Sahaj, or Ari,
or Dharm Bhava and Candr is in Dharm Bhava. Should there be
&#346;ukr and Rahu in Bandhu Bhava, while Lagn is occupied by
&#346;ani and Mangal, there will be a symbol of fish in the
palm, or sole, or ankles, (which according to Samudrika Shastr
is a Raj Lakshana denoting a king). Hamsh Yog is supposed to
give fish symbols in the palm, or sole, see notes under Sloka 8,
Ch.16.</p>

<p>The limbs of human body is divided by 36 Dreshkanas. Any
particular Dreshkan occupied by a benefic indicates a mole and a
malefic an ulcer on the particular part of the physique, see
Sloka 26, Ch. II of Sanketa Nidhi.</p>

<p>The 3 Dreshkanas in each Bhava represent limbs, respectively,
as under, vide Sanketa Nidhi: a) Lagn: 1. Head 2. Neck 3.
Pelvis. b) Dhan and Vyaya Bhava: 1. Right and left eyes 2. Right
and left shoulders 3. Genital organs. c) Sahaj and Labh Bhava:
1. Right and left ears 2.  Right and left arms. 3. Right and
left testicles. d) Bandhu and Karm Bhava: 1.  Right and left
nostrils 2. Right and left sides (Pasharva) 3. Right and left
thighs. e) Putr and Dharm Bhava: 1. Right and left cheeks 2.
Right and left side of the heart 3. Right and left knees. f) Ari
and Randhr Bhava: 1.Jaws 2.  Right and left sides of chest 3.
Right and left calves. g) Yuvati Bhava: 1.  Mouth 2. Navel 3.
Feet (according to some Vyaya Bhava indicates feet).</p>

<p>The above is from Sanketa Nidhi, Ch. IV, Slokas 124 and 125,
in which it is stated, that the limb corresponding to the
Dreshkan receiving a Drishti from, or yuti with a benefic will
have a mole, or mark. And a malefic in such a case causes its
deformity, or ulcer on it. For example, if Rahu is in Labh Bhava
in first Dreshkan, denoting right ear, he can cause either
deafness, or an ulcer of right ear. The reader is advantageously
referred to Slokas 24, 25 and 26, Ch. V of Brihat Jataka and
also my English translation of Saravali. Ch. IV for relevant
information.</p>

<p>Given below is a brief account regarding moles etc. from Ch.
IV of Mukunda Daviagna’s Nashta Jataka (my English translation):
Note the R&#257;&#347;is occupied by S&#363;rya and Candr. The
particular limbs, as represented with reference to Kala Purush,
i.e. Mesh etc., will have mole and other marks. The limb
represented by the R&#257;&#347;i occupied by S&#363;rya, or
Mangal will have reddish marks, while &#346;ani and Rahu leave
blue marks. Should &#346;ukr give a Drishti to Rahu, the limb
indicated by Rahu’s R&#257;&#347;i will have moles etc. Assume
Rahu is in Mithun opposed to &#346;ukr in Dhanu. Mithun
indicates arms of Kala Purush and hence there will be a mole (or
scar etc.) on the arms. More such information may be obtained
from Ch. IV of Nashta Jataka.</p>

<p>The information, furnished above, regarding moles etc., will
be helpful in rectification of natal Lagn in case of doubts.</p>

<p>The Shastras listed various combinations causing instant, or
sudden death of the child. Now only important ones are explained
(below).</p>

<p>There are three kinds of infant deaths.  Firstly the
afflictions due to parents; secondly due to Bal Grahas and
thirdly due to evil combinations of Grahas.</p>

<p>Notes: Bal Grahas are evil spirits, which affect only
children. See Sloka 130, Ch. 15 of Prashn Marga (J.N. BHASIN
English rendering). It is also stated in Jataka Parijata, Sloka
l, Ch 4, that till the child crosses 12, it is affected by the
fate of his mother and father and by Bal Grahas, i.e. evil
spirits. This view is identical with the one mentioned in Slokas
4-6, Ch. 10 of Sarvartha Chintamani. That is why all texts are
unanimous, that longevity cannot be definitely decided till the
12<sup>th</sup> year of age. Now see the following Sloka of the
present work.</p>

<p>It is only after a careful assessment of the above, the
affliction to the child should be pronounced. It is (however)
not possible to decide the longevity till it completes its
12<sup>th</sup> year of age. The child should be protected (till
such age) through Japas and Homas.</p>

<p>Notes: According to C.G. Rajan’s Tamil translation of
Parashar Hora. Ch. V, note, that longevity cannot be decided
till the native is 24. But Jyotisharnava Navaneetam (a Sanskrit
work with Telugu translation) suggests that. up to l2 nothing
definite can be said about longevity. Phala Deepika (Ch. 13,
Sloka 3) and Jataka Parijata (Ch. 5, Slokas 1 and 2), which have
similar verses also say, that up to 12, longevity cannot be
decided. This is because, the child is covered by its mother’s
fate in the first four years, by its father’s fate in the next
four years and by its Purva Karma thereafter up to 12, as per
Mantreswara. Only after 12, will the child be governed by the
effects of the Grahas in its own horoscope, as far as its
longevity is concerned Also see Slokas 4-6, Ch. X of Sarvartha
Chintamani.</p>

<p>The child born, when there is Lagn Sandhi is either born,
dead, or short lived (if born). Should such Lagn receive a
Drishti from malefics, the said results are sure to follow.
Birth in Gandanta Nakshatr is destructive of the whole family.
Should such a child, however, live, then it becomes a king with
an army of elephants and horses.</p>

<p>Notes: For Gandanta Nakshatra, see Sloka 14, Ch. I, supra.
Apart from Lagn Sandhi, there are other Sandhis, as explained in
Sloka 36, Ch. V, infra. Sarvartha Chintamani, Ch. l0, s. 26-27,
Uttarakalamrita, Ch. 8, Sloka 9 and Saravali also state, that,
if a Gandanta native survives, he becomes a king with elephants,
horses etc., forming his army.</p>

<p>Luminaries in Sahaj Bhava owned by a malefic and yuti with
malefics, make the child sick and live up to 3 years only.</p>

<p>If Candr joins Randhr’s lord in a Kendr, while Randhr Bhava
is occupied by a Grah, the child leaves this world soon after
its birth.</p>

<p>Should the 7<sup>th</sup> from Candr be occupied by Mangal
and S&#363;rya, while Rahu is in Lagn, death of the child may be
expected within ten days of birth.</p>

<p>Notes: Should Rahu be in Mesh, or Vrishabh, or Kark, as Lagn,
he contributes good longevity. Refer to Jatakadesa Marga (Ch.4),
Saravali (Ch. 12, s. 10), Jataka Parijata (Ch. 4, s. 90),
Sarvartha Chintamani, (Ch. 11, s. 16) and Jataka Marthanda, II
Part, (Ayurdhayadhyaya).  The Slokas of Saravali, Jataka
Parijata and Sarvartha Chintarnani are similar.  So to say, if
Rahu is in Mesh, or Vrishabh, or Kark in Lagn, while the rest of
the combination, as per the Sloka under comment is present,
there is good longevity.</p>

<p>Malefics in Bandhu, Randhr, Dhan and Vyaya Bhava will cause
sickness and death in l0 days. Should a malefic be in Yuvati
Bhava from rising Dreshkan (22<sup>nd</sup> Dreshkan), while the
waning Candr is in Lagn the child faces immediate death.</p>

<p>When all the Grahas are weak and positioned in Sahaj, Ari,
Dharm and Vyaya Bhava, the child lives either for 2 months, or 6
months. While Lagn’s lord is in his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i,
or in Randhr Bhava, or is combust, the child’s living becomes
precarious and it is equal to a dead one.</p>

<p>A child born under malefic Muhurtas, or, when a Ketu is
rising followed by fall of meteors, thunders etc., it hardly
lives.</p>

<p>The persons, who are born with severe Yogal indicating
adverse results, as explained by Yavanas and others will only
bring harm to the family.</p>

<p>A person born under an eclipse, or, when there is Parivesh,
or, when a malefic occupies Lagn, or gives a Drishti to Lagn,
lives only for three fortnights, or for three months.</p>

<p>Notes: Birth on the day of eclipse is ominous. If the Lagn is
connected with many strong malefics by yuti, or association,
then also it is adverse for longevity.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord, the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i and the
Navamsh lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i are all eclipsed, the
longevity is only for a few days.</p>

<p>Notes: The combustion of three Grahas are indicated, namely
that of Lagn Lord, dispositor of Candr and Navamsh lord of
Candr. Such combustion will prove fatal to longevity and the
child’s life is only for a few days.</p>

<p>The four kinds of junctions, or conjunction of Candr with
malefics will cause death (infant1) and similar results follow,
if Candr is in aspect to mllefics without benefic’s aspect, or
company.</p>

<p>Notes: The four junctions, or Sandhi chathushtayas are: 1)
The twilight time, 2) The point, where two R&#257;&#347;is meet,
3) The point, where two stars meet, 4) The time, when two
thithis meet.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in the company of malefics only, or, if she
is in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, or the 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava and
be with malefics without benefic’s aspect, or association death
of the native will occur.</p>

<p>Notes: The Sloka seems to suggest infant death. Candr, if
connected with malefics should be helped by benefics, so that
infant death does not occur.</p>

<p>Should the Lagn Lord and Candr’s dispositor be in the
6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, or the 12<sup>th</sup>, or be
combust, the death of the native may be foretold in the year
denoted by the R&#257;&#347;i occupied by the said Grahas.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in the 6<sup>th</sup>, or the 8<sup>th</sup>,
while the Lagn is occupied by its lord, or, when the decreasing
Candris subject to mixed influences of malefics and benefics,
the native, if born in day time has short life.</p>

<p>If the lord of Lagn is in Marana Pada along with the
decreasing Candrin the company of Rahu, or aspected by Rahu, the
native dies in his seventh year.</p>

<p>If Candr is weak and aspected by Rahu associated with
malefics, or, if the Lagn Lord (or Candr R&#257;&#347;i lord)
has set in (i.e. the 7<sup>th</sup> from Lagn), or occupies the
8<sup>th</sup>, the child lives upto its 6<sup>th</sup>, or
8<sup>th</sup> year Notes: The Lagn Lord in the 7<sup>th</sup>
(a Marakasthana), or in the 8<sup>th</sup> is adverse for
longevity unless well aspected. But Phala Deepika says, that the
Bhava occupied by the Lord of Lagng stands to gain. However, the
position of Lagna Lord in the 8<sup>th</sup> shakes the
foundation of the horoscope.</p>

<p>The Lagn lord with Rahu in the 7<sup>th</sup> brings death in
21 years, or 21 months, or (even) in 21 days.</p>

<p>Notes: We may infer, that the above maximum (21 years)
longevity can be expected, if other Grahas are considerably
strong.  Should they be also weak, death may occur in 21 months
and utterly weak ones bring death in 21 days. On the whole, the
combination of Rahu and Lagn Lord in the 7<sup>th</sup> should
be assessed in the context of the whole horoscope.</p>

<p>Add the R&#257;&#347;i sphutas of S&#363;rya and Candr. If
the particular R&#257;&#347;i, or its angle, or the
9<sup>th</sup> Bhava thereof be occupied by a malefic, death
comes to pass due to poison, or water (i.e. drowning, rains,
foods etc.).</p>

<p>Notes: Suppose S&#363;rya’s longitude is 175 and that of
Candr is 292. Then the sum equals to 467’ and after expunging
360, v get 107, i.e. Kark 17. The angles of Kark are: Kark,
Tula, Makar and Mesh; and the 9<sup>th</sup> from Kark is Meen.
So any malefic in any of these five R&#257;&#347;is (around 17
in particular) will cause the said results.</p>

<p>If a malefic planet is in the 8<sup>th</sup> Bhava, while
Lagn lord is in angle in the company of a malefic, without
benefic’s aspect, death in the 7<sup>th</sup> year may be
predicted.</p>

<p>If Budh and S&#363;rya be together and aspected by benefics
the child will die in its eleventh year even, if it were on the
laps of Gods.</p>

<p>Notes: There is apparently something wrong in this Sloka. We
do not understand, why S&#363;rya and Budh, when aspected by
benefics should prove harmful to longevity. There are only two
other benefics, i.e. Guru and &#346;ukr. &#346;ukr cannot aspect
the combination of S&#363;rya and Budh. The only Grah, that can
thus aspect is Guru. His aspect cannot be considered adverse to
longevity.</p>

<p>From Mesh onwards, the fateful degrees are:  8, 9, 22, 22,
25, 14, 4, 23, 18, 20, 21 and 10. Births in these degrees invite
death soon. The same for Candr from Mesh onwards are: 26, 12,
13, 25, 24, 4, 26, 14, 13, 25, 5 and 12 degrees. Notes: Phala
Deepika, Ch. 13, Slokas 10 and 11 quote the above degrees
fateful for Lagn and Moon. But it does not state, that birth
will accordingly inflict death. Jataka Tatwa, (B-108) states,
that the following degrees are, respectively, fateful for Candr:
8, 9, 23, 22, 5, 1, 4, 23, 18, 20, 21 and 10 from Mesh onwards
and death will be caused in the year denoted by such degree.
Saravali (Ch. 10, Slokas 111 to 113) give the following fateful
degrees for Candr, respectively, from Mesh onwards: 8, 9, 22,
22, 25, 1, 4, 23, 18, 20, 21 and 10.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in her fateful degrees, mentioned above and
be in the company of a malefic, without relief from benefics, or
be in the 8<sup>th</sup> Bhava, or in angle (in such a fateful
degree), the child not only dies itself, but takes away its
mother too.</p>

<p>Notes: Candr should be in her fateful degrees along with a
malefic without benefic aspect. Alternatively she can be in the
8<sup>th</sup>, Lagn, 4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, or
10<sup>th</sup>.  Either combination can cause death of the
child and the mother.</p>

<p>Should the Lagn Lord be strong and occupy an angle, or trine,
even the ArishtaYogas. indicating infant death can be
overcome.</p>

<p>Notes: Following are some of the combinations, that nullify
such evils. Guru not combust and in Lagn, or Lagn Lord with
strength and in good aspects, or all Grahas in their own
R&#257;&#347;is, or Candr in deep exaltation, or own Bhava, or
friendly Navamsh and in good aspect, or Candr in a friendly
decanate along with a friendly Grah, or Candr’s kendra occupied
by Guru.</p>

<p>A benefic Grah with strength in angle, not joining the
8<sup>th</sup> Lord, leads to nullificaion of Arishta Yoga
(causing death) in a nativity, or prevailing at the time of a
query.</p>

<p>If a strong Grah is in Lagn, the 4<sup>th</sup>, or the
10<sup>th</sup> and be not in the company of S&#363;rya, the
malefic Yogas (for short life) will vanish.</p>

<p>Many evil Yogas make the sustaining of the child difficult.
But, if Candr, or Lagn receives the aspect of all the Grahas,
these Yogas disappear, as darkness does before S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>Notes: The single aspect of Guru is enough on thc Candr,
which can act, like a lion throwing away a thousand elephants
(see Jatakadesa Marga).</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 5<sup>th</sup> Ch. Arishtas in Horashara of
Prithuyasas, son of Varaha Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=6>Ch. 6. Arishta Yog</a></h2>

<p>The evils causing infant deaths have since been explained.
Now, the Arishtas (causing death), arising out of combinations
of Grahas are explained (i.e. for elders too), as below. During
the period of a Grah capable of inflicting evils, if Bal
Arishtas simultaneously exist, then the evil is greater.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord, or the dispositor of Candr be yuti with
S&#363;rya and be without Drishti from a benefic, while malefics
are in Kendras, the native dies in his 20<sup>th</sup> year.</p>

<p>The rising of Mangal in Lagn, while S&#363;rya and &#346;ani
in strength are in Kendras, brings about the end of the native
within 20 years. If, however, such death does not occur, there
will be danger to his limbs, or he will become sick.</p>

<p>Should Mangal and S&#363;rya be in Lagn, which is a moveable
R&#257;&#347;i, while Guru is in Karm Bhava and Candr in Putr,
or Dharm Bhava, the native will die in his 20<sup>th</sup>
year.</p>

<p>If the decreasing Candr is in Randhr Bhava and in Vrischik
Navamsh the native’s death will take place. (The longevity span
is not mentioned here; but it is said to be short life Yog) He
will at the maximum live up to 25 years, if Candr receives a
Drishti from &#346;ani and Mangal.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in the 8<sup>th</sup> from Candr, weak
benefics in Sahaj, Ari, Dharm, or Vyaya Bhava, while Candr
herself is in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the life span is at the most
25.</p>

<p>If both, Randhr’s lord and the 8<sup>th</sup> lord from Candr
occupy Kendras, while Randhr Bhava and the 8<sup>th</sup> Bhava
from Candr are occupied by a Grah and Candr and Lagn are devoid
of strength, the native will not cross thirty.</p>

<p>Should malefics occupy Dhan and Vyaya Bhava along with Guru
and Rahu and Candr are in Yuvati, or Randhr Bhava, the longevity
of the person is not above thirty.</p>

<p>Should a malefic set along with S&#363;rya (i.e. being in
Yuvati Bhava from Lagn only and not in the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava
from Candr) and be yuti with Rahu and Guru, while Candr is in
Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the life span is 30.</p>

<p>The Yog caused by the position of &#346;ukr and Guru in Lagn,
while Mangal and &#346;ani are in Putr Bhava and Candr is
waning, produces a person with short life.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya and Candr yuti with Rahu will cause death at the
age of 28. It is more certain, if Guru is also in Vyaya
Bhava.</p>

<p>If Randhr’s lord from Lagn is in a Kendr along with Candr,
while Randhr Bhava is occupied by a Grah and Kendras be devoid
of Drishti from benefics, or occupation of benefics, the
longevity is only 32.</p>

<p>Should the waning Candr be in Kark, while Randhr’s lord is in
a Kendr and Randhr Bhava is in turn occupied by a malefic and
Lagn’s lord is devoid of strength, the span of life is only
30.</p>

<p>Note the longitudes of Lagn’s lord and Randhr’s lord. When
added, if it results in a Kendr, or in Randhr Bhava and a
malefic occupies that resultant place, the end comes in the
27<sup>th</sup> year.</p>

<p>Should Randhr’s lord be in a Kon, while Randhr Bhava is
occupied by Lagn’s lord, who in turn is in Drishti to, or yuti
with malefics, the person lives up to 24, even though there is
benefic Drishti on Lagn’s lord and on Randhr’s lord.</p>

<p>If Guru receives a Drishti from &#346;ani, or is yuti with
Rahu and a malefic is in Lagn, while Randhr Bhava is occupied,
the life span is only 22.</p>

<p>Should Lagn be occupied by its lord, while S&#363;rya and
Candr are in Bandhu Bhava together with malefics and Randhr’s
lord is in a Kendr, the end of life is at 30.</p>

<p>If Randhr’s lord occupies a Kendr, while Lagn’s lord is
devoid of strength, the subject lives only up to 30, or 32.</p>

<p>Should Candr and Lagn’s lord be weak, receiving Drishti from
malefics and be in Apoklima Bhavas (i.e. Sahaj, Ari, Dharm,
Vyaya Bhava), the life span is just 40.</p>

<p>If Guru and &#346;ukr ar in a Kendr, while Lagn’s lord is
yuti with malefics in a Apoklima Bhava, a person born before
nightfall lives only up to 36.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be in Lagn, which is an inimical
R&#257;&#347;i to him and be hemmed between malefics, the person
will always be sick and his end comes at his 36<sup>th</sup>
year.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and Candr be in Lagn and benefics be in a
Bhava other than a Kendr, or Randhr Bhava, one born in Gulika’s
Muhurta will live up to 36.</p>

<p>If Lagn falls in a fixed R&#257;&#347;i and Randhr’s lord is
in Lagn, while Randhr Bhava has a benefic in it, the life span
is only 40.</p>

<p>When Lagn’s lord is in the 8<sup>th</sup> Navamsh and
Randhr’s lord is in Lagn Navamsh along with malefics, the span
of life is only 50.</p>

<p>Should the Kendras be devoid of Grahas and Lagn’s lord be not
associated with malefics, while malefics are in Putr Bhava, a
life span of 60 should be declared.</p>

<p>If Lagn’s lord is weak and is in Vyaya Bhava, the person
lives for 60 years, provided Guru is not in Lagn.</p>

<p>When the ruler of Randhr Bhava is in a Kendr, Mangal in in
Lagn and S&#363;rya along with &#346;ani is in Sahaj, or Ari
Bhava, the person will live up to 44.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in Vargothamamsh, receiving a Drishti from
malefics and occupy Lagn, while benefics are without strength,
the person lives up to 48 years.</p>

<p>If benefics are in malefic R&#257;&#347;is and Navamshas
other than Kendras, while malefics are in Kendras, the longevity
is only medium.</p>

<p>&#346;ani is a dual R&#257;&#347;i, which is rising, while
Candr is in Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, the life span is 52
years.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be in Lagn, identical with Kark, or
Vrischik along with malefics, while Candr is in Dhan Bhava and
Guru is in any R&#257;&#347;i other than a Kendr, the person
lives for 50 years.</p>

<p>If malefics are in Bandhu and Randhr Bhava from Lagn, or in
the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 8<sup>th</sup> from Candr and do not
receive a Drishti from, or are not yuti with benefics, the
person had only medium span of life.</p>

<p>Should Guru and &#346;ukr be together, while malefics are in
Bandhu and Karm Bhava and Candr is in Vyaya Bhava, the life span
is medium.</p>

<p>If Lagn’s lord is in a Navamsh of &#346;ani, while Candr
along with Randhr’s lord is in Ari/Randhr/Vyaya Bhava, the
native so born will live 58 years of his life.</p>

<p>A Raj Yog is formed, when all Grahas are posited in Ari,
Randhr and Vyaya Bhava. Such Raj Yog gives the native a life
span of 58 years.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in the 6<sup>th</sup>, the 8<sup>th</sup>,
or the 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava, with reference to Lagn’s lord,
while there are no benefics in Randhr Bhava the native lives for
60 years.</p>

<p>When the lords of Lagn and Candr R&#257;&#347;i are combust,
or are in Yuvati and Randhr Bhava and Guru is in a Bhava other
than a Kendr, the longevity of the person is 65 years.</p>

<p>The Yog of S&#363;rya, Mangal and &#346;ani in Lagn, while
Guru is devoid of strength and Candr is in Putr, or Vyaya Bhava,
gives a longevity of 70 years.</p>

<p>Should there be a minimum of four Grahas in the first four
Bhavas commencing from Lagn, the native is blessed with long
life, wisdom and wealth. If there are four, or more Grahas in
the next four Bhavas the longevity is sixty, while a similar
disposition from Dharm Bhava onwards in the last four Bhavas
makes a person short lived.</p>

<p>If malefics occupy Bhavas owned by malefic Grahas, or Bhavas
considered evil, while benefics are in Kendras, the person’s
longevity will be 80 years. Should there be a mix it is only
60.</p>

<p>When Guru and Candr are in Bandhu Bhava, Lagn’s lord is in
Labh Bhava with strength and benefics (or Budh) are in Karm
Bhava, the person lives up to 80.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya, Mangal and &#346;ani be in Kendras
obtaining Dhanu, or Meen Amshas, while Guru is in Lagn and the
rest are in any Bhava other than Randhr Bhava, the native lives
up to 85.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in malefic Bhavas and benefics be in
benefic Bhavas, while Lagn’s lord has strength, long life may be
predicted.</p>

<p>Mangal in Randhr Bhava, S&#363;rya in Lagn and Guru in a
Kendr: this Yog gives a longevity of 100 years. Should the
Kendras, Konas and Randhr Bhava be not occupied by malefics,
while Lagn’s lord and Guru are in Kendras, the native lives up
to 100. Such a person is free from diseases, enjoys all kinds of
happiness and strives for a common cause.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya, Mangal and &#346;ani be in moveable
Navamshas, while Guru and &#346;ukr are in fixed Navamshas and
the rest of the Grahas are in dual Navamshas: this Yog gives a
long lease of life, weapons and kingdom.</p>

<p>A person lives for one hundred years remaining free from
diseases, if in his nativity benefics are in Bandhu, or Dharm
Bhava and in odd Navamshas, malefics are in Lagn and in even
Amshas and Candr is in Lagn with full rays (i.e. full Candr in
Lagn).</p>

<p>If Lagn’s lord has great strength, not receiving Drishti from
malefics, but receiving Drishti from benefics only and be in a
Kendr, the native has long lease of life and is of virtuous and
royal disposition.</p>

<p>If Randhr’s lord excels the ruler of Lagn in strength and is
in a Kendr, while malefics are in Randhr and Vyaya Bhava, the
native is short lived, or in the case of medium life, it is with
hardships.</p>

<p>Now, the combinations for extraordinary span of life.</p>

<p>Should Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr be in same R&#257;&#347;i, or
Navamsh, or occupy Lagn, while &#346;ani is in Dharm Bhava, the
native lives for a Yuga with the help of chemical tonics, or
boosters.</p>

<p>Should Guru, Budh and &#346;ani be disposed anywhere in
Bandhu, Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava, but be together in one
Navamsh, the native lives for 2000 years.</p>

<p>All the Grahas in the Navamshas of Dhanu and Meen and in
Kendras, Dharm, or Dhan Bhava, in the R&#257;&#347;i Kundali,
make a person follow ascetic course in the very boyhood, live
for a full Yuga and write many works relating to Shastras.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya, Mangal and Guru be in Navamsh owned by
&#346;ani and are posited in Kendras, or Dharm Bhava in the
R&#257;&#347;i Kundali, while Candr is at the end of a
R&#257;&#347;i in Lagn, the person lives for a Yuga with
wealth.</p>

<p>If the Dharm’s lord is in Dharm Bhava in Drishti to Mangal,
while Candr is in Vrischik Navamsh, or Mesh Navamsh there
obtains a Muni Yog in the nativity and the person becomes a
superior sage, writes many works relating to Shastras and lives
for a Yuga.</p>

<p>If Candr is not decreasing (i.e. be waxing) and occupies a
friendly R&#257;&#347;i and friendly Navamsh coinciding with
Labh Bhava, or Lagn, while Dharm Bhava has &#346;ani in it, the
person lives for uncountable years.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani and Guru are together in Dhan, Dharm, or Karm
Bhava and in one Navamsh, while S&#363;rya and Budh rise in
Lagn, the native is liked by the sages and has a long lease of
life.</p>

<p>Those born with the above mentioned extraordinarily long life
combinations will be able to control their senses, just as the
sages and chant religious hymns. They live in caves using divine
medicines.</p>

<p>I have thus explained these Yogas, as explained by Yavanas
with the help of my past deeds. The sum effects of these Yogas
should be decided in various Dasha Bhuktis after a careful
analysis.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 6<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Arishta Yog” in
Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=7>Ch. 7. Ayurdayadhya</a></h2>

<p>I shall now explain in a clear and careful way the method of
knowing the Dasha periods for those, that are born under the
Yogas stated earlier.</p>

<p>The numerous methods of assessing longevity have been clearly
stipulated by old scholars Maya, Yavana, Siddhasena, Prabodha,
Mandavya and Vishnu Gupta.</p>

<p>Should the Grahas commencing from S&#363;rya onwards remain
in their highest exaltation points, they contribute 19, 25, 15,
12, 1 5, 21 and 20 years for the total longevity of the
native.</p>

<p>The Grah, that is at its deepest debilitation degree
contributes half of the above mentioned years. Should it be
anywhere in between, then the number of years will have to be
found by proportional calculations.</p>

<p>Note the difference between a Grah’s actual position and deep
debilitation point and multiply this figure by the figure of
Pindayurdaya year (Sloka 3 supra) and arrive at the Grah’s
contribution to longevity.</p>

<p>Deduction for Grahas in combustion, inimical Bhavas and the
visible half, that are involved in war between Grahas, or, that
are close to Rahu etc., should be made only after being suitably
taught by a Guru.</p>

<p>Amshayurdaya calculations should be made, as above and the
deductions for Grahas posited in Vyaya, Labh, Karm, Dharm,
Randhr and Yuvati Bhava should be made, as under: 1, &frac12;,
1/3<sup>rd</sup>, &frac14;, 1/5<sup>th</sup>, 1/6<sup>th</sup>,
respectively. This is in the case of malefics. For benefics,
only 50% of the reduction, as above applies. Grahas lose half of
their contribution, if in fall, or in combustion. In the matter
of Vyayadiharana (i.e. position in Vyaya, Labh, Karm, Dharm,
Randhr and Yuvati Bhava), if both malefics and benefics are
together in one Bhava, then no deduction applies to benefics. If
there are two Grahas in the same Bhava, then the deduction
should be only through the strongest of the two.</p>

<p>The Grahas, except Mangal, if they occupy inimical Bhavas,
lose a third of their contribution. The eclipsed Grahas lose
half of their contribution except &#346;ukr and &#346;ani.
Those, that have lost in war between Grahas lose one third. The
luminaries lose 1/12<sup>th</sup>, if they join the nodes.</p>

<p>Notes: There is no reduction for Mangal even, if he be in an
enemy’s Bhava. S&#363;rya is the Grah, that combusts others.
Hence, the half reduction does not apply to him apart from
&#346;ukr and &#346;ani (as &#346;ukr and the &#346;ani do not
lose their rays even, if they are combust (vide
Uttarakalamrita). Lastly, S&#363;rya and Candr do not involve in
war between Grahas; as such no reduction applies to them on this
count. Mangal is strong even in his enemy’s Bhava.</p>

<p>The contribution in number of years by Lagn equals to the
number of Navamshas it has passed, when counted from Mesh. If
Lagn is strong and occupied by a benefic, the figure should be
multiplied by one fourth and, if it be weak and occupied by
malefics, then, the figure should be reduced by one fourth.
Thus, the period contributed by Lagn should be computed.</p>

<p>Notes: Suppose Lagn (be it in any R&#257;&#347;i) falls in
Vrischik Navamsh, its contribution is 8 years, as the
R&#257;&#347;i Vrischik is the 8<sup>th</sup> from Mesh.
Further, this figure has to be modified thus:, if benefics are
there or, if Lagn is strong (by way of Shad Bal calculations),
the contribution 8 becomes 10, when one fourth is increased.
Should Lagn be weak, or occupied by a malefic, then, one fourth
is to be reduced, i.e the said figure becomes 6 only.</p>

<p>The longevity will be exactly arrived at by assessing a
Grah’s exact position from its exaltation and debilitation
points, if the Grah has benefic company, or, when Lagn is strong
and falling in a benefic’s Bhava, or, when Yuvati Bhava is
occupied.</p>

<p>While the system of calculating longevity by exaltation and
debilitation process is common to all human beings, the
difference between Dasha (i.e. periods) and Samskara (i.e.
process of rectification by proper deductions) should be
considered carefully.</p>

<p>The process of rectification, or deduction from Dasha years
contributed should be made with the help of the strongest
Navamsh. A wise Jyotishi shall do so after assessing the
strength of the two.</p>

<p>Note the longitudes of the Grahas in terms of R&#257;&#347;i,
degrees and minutes. Multiply this by 108 and divide by 12 and
the remainder will indicate the years contributed.</p>

<p>The multiplier is two, if the Grah is in its own Navamsh, or
Dreshkan, or R&#257;&#347;i, or Vargothama Navamsh. It is to be
trebled, if it is in retrograde motion, or in exalted state. It
should be halved, if the Grah is in fall.</p>

<p>The reductions for Mangal should be done here too, as
explained for Pindayurdaya and, while occupying inimical Bhavas.
Lagn will contribute the same number of years, as the Navamshas
attained by it.</p>

<p>Amshaurdaya shall be resorted to, if Lagn is the strongest.
Should S&#363;rya be the strongest, then Pindayurdaya is
recommended. Naisargikayu is adopted, if Candr is the strongest.
If all the Grahas be in own Bhavas, exaltation Bhavas, or in
such Navamshas, then also Amshayurdaya is recommended. The same
applies, if the Grahas are not yuti with Lagn, S&#363;rya and
Candr.</p>

<p>There is another method of Ayurdaya enumerated by Jeevasarma.
I now detail the same in the following verses.</p>

<p>Note the longitudinal distance between a Grah’s position and
its deep fall degree. Convert this into minutes and divide by
21600. The quotient will reveal the years contributed. The
remainder should be multiplied by 12 and divided again by 21,
the quotient is months. Again multiply the latest remainder by
21600. The days are represented by the quotient. Multiply the
latest remainder by 60 and the quotient will yield Ghaties.</p>

<p>Notes: If the Grah is past its debilitation point and be
towards its exaltation, then the longitudinal distance be
calculated from deep fall to its position.</p>

<p>Reduce 17 year I month 22days 8 Ghaties and 34 Vighaties, if
the Grah is close to its exaltation. Should it be close to its
debilitation, then add a similar figure.</p>

<p>The deductions do not apply to &#346;ukr and &#346;ani, if
they are eclipsed and also to Mangal in his enemy’s Bhava.</p>

<p>Lagn’s contribution is equal to the number of Navamshas it
attained. A malefic there in reduces the figure by one fourth
and a benefic there in increases the figure by one fourth.</p>

<p>According to Jeevasarma, Grahas in Dhan and Vyaya Bhava from
Lagn and Grahas in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup>
from Candr, all Grahas near their debilitation point, those,
that are devoid of strength and those in Lagn, or in Yuvati
Bhava will reduce the contribution to one seventh of the total
life.</p>

<p>Now, about Trinal reduction (Trikon Shodhana) with reference
to Ashtak Vargas. First draw a Kundali of R&#257;&#347;is, as
usual. Mark benefic dots of Ashtak Varg of the Grah required and
then Trikon reductions should be made.</p>

<p>Notes: The author now deals with the Bandhu system of
assessing longevity. For detailed calculations of Ashtak Varg
system refer to works, like Brihat Jataka, Saravali, Dr. B.V.
Raman’s Ashtak Varg System of Predictions etc. Simultaneously,
Ch. 17 infra may also be seen.</p>

<p>For the purpose of deductions take the sets of Mesh and its
Konas, Vrishabh and its Konas, Mithun and its Konas and Kark and
its Konas In each set, whichever is the least, put the same in
the other two. If one of the three is vacant, no change should
be made in the other two.  If two R&#257;&#347;is are vacant,
then the third one should also be made dotless. Lastly, if all
the three R&#257;&#347;is are equal with dots, vacate dots in
all the three R&#257;&#347;is.</p>

<p>The above is the method of trinal reductions. Now the method
of reduction to the pairs of R&#257;&#347;is, which have common
lords is explained below. This is called Ekadhipathya Shodhana.
This reduction is applicable, when there are benefic dots in
both the R&#257;&#347;is owned by a Grah. Should there be less
number of dots in a R&#257;&#347;i, while the other
R&#257;&#347;i (of the same Grah) is not occupied, the smaller
number of dots shall be used for both the R&#257;&#347;is. If
the occupied R&#257;&#347;i has more dots than the occupied
R&#257;&#347;i, then make the dots nil in the unoccupied
R&#257;&#347;i. (The occupation can be by any Grah) Similar
reduction applies, when there are equal number of dots in both
the R&#257;&#347;is owned by a Grah, but one of them should be
free from occupation. Should both the R&#257;&#347;is be
occupied, no reduction shall be made. Should there be the same
number of dots in both the R&#257;&#347;is, which are not
occupied, dots should be made nil in both the R&#257;&#347;is.
If one of the R&#257;&#347;is is vacant in respect of dots,
retain dots in the other R&#257;&#347;i. The rules for
Ekadhipathya Shodhana do not apply to Kark and Simh.</p>

<p>Notes: The suggestions given in Slokas 32-37 are for
reductions applicable to two R&#257;&#347;is owned by one Grah
and are called Ekadhipathya reductions, which should be done
after trinal reductions. Since Candr and S&#363;rya have each
one R&#257;&#347;i only, there is no Ekadhipathya Shodhana for
Kark and Simh.</p>

<p>The final figures in each R&#257;&#347;i, after effecting
trinal reduction as well, as Ekadhipathya reduction, as above,
be multiplied by the concerned R&#257;&#347;i multipliers and,
if a particular R&#257;&#347;i is occupied the figure must be
multiplied by the respective Grah’s multiplier. The
R&#257;&#347;i multipliers from Mesh onwards are: 7, 10, 8, 4,
10, 5, 7, 8, 9, 5, 11 and 12, respectively.</p>

<p>‘The figures of multiplication for Guru, Mangal, &#346;ukr
and Budh are 10, 8, 7 and 5, respectively. The multiplier is 5,
or other Grahas (i.e. for S&#363;rya, Candr and &#346;ani).  The
multipliers for R&#257;&#347;is and Grahas should be treated
separately.  The dots in the 12 R&#257;&#347;is, obtained after
Trinal and Ekadhipathya reductions should be multiplied by
R&#257;&#347;i multipliers individually.  Should a
R&#257;&#347;i be occupied by a Grah, the dots should be
multiplied by Grah Gunakara.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;i figure and Grah figure (as obtained
through process explained in Slokas 38-40&frac12;) should be
added in respect of each Grah, together. (This can be called
Shodya Pinda. This Pinda should be multiplied by 7 and divided
by 27. The quotient is years of longevity by the Grah concerned.
Multiply the remainder by 27 to get months. The next remainder
is multiplied by 30 and divided by 27 to get days. The latest
remainder is multiplied by 60 and divided by 27 to get Ghatis.
27 years make one Mandala and so the years in excess of 27 (for
each Grah) should be rejected.</p>

<p>Notes: According to Sambhu Hora, if the contribution of years
is in excess of 27, but less than 54, then subtract the quotient
from 54. If the quotient is more than 54, subtract it from 81
and, if above 81 subtract from 108.</p>

<p>The contribution of each Grah should be worked out, as
explained in the Slokas above.</p>

<p>The contribution of a Grah should be halved, if it is yuti
with another Grah. Similar halving should be done, if a Grah is
debilitated, or eclipsed. For a Grah posited in an enemy’s
Bhava, the loss is one third. This applies also to those in the
visible half of the Zodiac, those, that have lost in war between
Grahas and those, that are in the Pata range of the luminaries.
When a Grah warrants repeated deductions, then, only the highest
should be done. The figures for all the Grahas should be added
together and multiplied by 324 and divided by 365. The net
longevity is equal to the quotient in the process.</p>

<p>Notes: The above reductions are explained thus. Suppose Budh
has contributed 12 years, the reductions are, as under: a) If he
is along with another Grah, in the R&#257;&#347;i Kundali, then
his contribution is halved, i. e. only 6 years; b) If Budh is
combust, or in Neech, then also half is deduced. (Combustion
need not necessarily occur, when S&#363;rya is in the same
R&#257;&#347;i. Only the longitudinal distance counts. Suppose
Budh is in 28 degrees of Simh, while S&#363;rya is in 2 degrees
of Kanya. Even then Budh is combust). c) If Budh in the example
is in his enemy’s Bhava, then one third reduction should be
made, i.e. 12 is reduced to 8. d) If it is in the visible half
of the zodiac, then also 1/3<sup>rd</sup> should be rejected.
Visible half means the area from Lagn BhavaMadhya to
7<sup>th</sup> BhavaMadhya counted backwards. According to Dr.
B.V. Raman; the reduction for malefic Grahas in the visible half
should be done, as under: 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava: Full,
11<sup>th</sup> 1/4<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>
1/3<sup>rd</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> 1/4<sup>th</sup>,
8<sup>th</sup> 1/5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>
l/6<sup>th</sup>. He continues to say, that for benefics 50% of
the above should be applicable for the 6 Bhavas. e) One third
reduction is made, if a Grah is involved in war. (War does not
apply to S&#363;rya and Candr) f) One third reduction should be
made, if a Grah is involved in Rahugrasta S&#363;rya, or Candr
Grahanas. Pata means Rahu’s path. Hence Pata range of S&#363;rya
and Candr is interpreted, as above. g) Only the highest
reduction should be enforced, if a Grah attracts more than one
reduction, as mentioned from a toe above. In such case, only
half is reduced once. But according to Dr. Raman, there is full
reduction in the case of a malefic in Vyaya Bhava from Lagn,
which of course can be done only once.</p>

<p>The contribution by each Grah in years etc.  should be found,
as above and total Dashas should be known accordingly.</p>

<p>Among all the systems of Ayurdaya, Ashtak Varg is the best
one. The longevity should be evaluated, through Ashtak Varg
system, when Candr is in Kendr and yuti with a Grah, while Karm
Bhava has both benefics and malefics in it.</p>

<p>The benefic dots in the seven Ashtak Vargas (i.e. considering
the Grahas from S&#363;rya to &#346;ani) should be added
R&#257;&#347;i wise to get the Sarvashtak Varg figures and then
only trinal reductions and Ekadhipathya reductions should be
made.</p>

<p>If any R&#257;&#347;i has more than 12 bindus, then retain
only 12. All the R&#257;&#347;is should be reduced to such
process.</p>

<p>Notes: When the Sarvashtak Varg is subjected to what is
called Mandala Shodhana, as explained in this Sloka, we get
corrected Sarvashtak Varg Kundali.</p>

<p>The said figures (after reductions) should be multiplied by
the R&#257;&#347;i multipliers and Grah multipliers (as
explained in 38 to 40&frac12; supra) and the total should be
multiplied by 7 and divided by 27. The quotient will give
longevity in years.</p>

<p>Should the quotient cross 100, expunge the multiples of 100
and, if the native is of long life (as per the suggestions of
horoscope), then retain only 100. The figure should be then
multiplied by 324 and divided by 365.</p>

<p>The rectified longevity of all the Grahas should be collected
together. The contribution of each Grah is arrived at, as under:
The Dasha periods worked out, as per Bhinnashtak Varg method
should be added together and converted into Ghaties. This figure
is to be kept, as divisor. The Ashtak Varg Ghatis should be
multiplied by various Bhinnashtak Varg Dasha figures and divided
by the divisor referred to above. The quotient indicates the
years contributed.</p>

<p>The days, months and years should be computed, as above.
Thus, exact periods of longevity contributed by each Grah should
be calculated.</p>

<p>The method of the calculations af Dasha periods, contributed
by each Grah through Ashtak Varg has already been explained.
When the Lagn is strong, the years contributed by Lagn is equal
to the figures signified by Lagn R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>The years contributed by Lagn should be known only after
ascertaining by both the methods. The Ashtak Varg Dasha system
is found acceptable to all.</p>

<p>Should there be any problem in working out Dasha periods due
to conjunction of Grahas, then a different method may be
adopted. The Grah’s exaltation, or depression should be made use
of to find out Dasha periods.</p>

<p>If the Grahas occupy inimical, or depression R&#257;&#347;is,
Yavana’s school of thought should be followed to calculate the
contribution of the Grahas.</p>

<p>Should Candr be yuti with another Grah and be in a Kendr,
while all other Grahas are out of Kendras, then according to
Manitha, the Samudayashta Varg system is to be resorted to.</p>

<p>Should all Grahas be in one Bhava other than a Kendr, then
the effects of Dasha arising out of Ayurdaya contributions
cannot be estimated at all.</p>

<p>If a person born is of short life, or long life (unduly long
life ?), the longevity cannot be determined through the method
of Dasha periods of the Grahas. Malefics in Ari, Randhr and
Vyaya Bhava will make one short lived. Benefics in the said
Bhavas will give long life.  Middle life should be predicted, if
there is a mix of good and bad Grahas in these Bhavas.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 7<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Ayurdayadhya in
Horashara, of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=8>Ch. 8. Dasha Phal Nirupana</a></h2>

<p>The Dasha of the strongest comes first among Lagn, S&#363;rya
and Candr. Then comes the Dasha of the Grah, that is angular,
while the third Dasha is of that, which is non-angular. Should
all the three be of equal strength, then the order is based on
larger number of years contributed. Should even the years be not
different, then the one rises after next conjunction will be
predominant. Finally, if these risings are similar, then the
Dasha of the one, that has risen first will lead the scheme.</p>

<p>Based on the strength of the above mentioned trinity, the
three various stages of life will be effective in order.  The
strength, or otherwise of these three will decide the effects of
the three stages of life.</p>

<p>Should the dispositor of Candr be exalted, in a friend’s
Bhava, in his own Varg/R&#257;&#347;i and have no Drishti of
malefics, then she will powerfully reveal the qualities of
Lagn’s lord and prove auspicious to the native from the very
birth.</p>

<p>Should all the benefics be in Sahaj, Ari and Labh Bhava, the
subject will be happy in his early part of life. Malefics in
these Bhavas will give issues in the second part of one’s
life.</p>

<p>Should the Dasha of Lagn be not open at birth, then some
other Dasha may occur. However, some do not subscribe to this
viewpoint. The right way should be conceived per mercy of the
preceptor.</p>

<p>The Dasha of a Grah leaving its exaltation R&#257;&#347;i is
called Avarohini Dasha and the good results gradually diminish.
Similarly, when a Grah is approaching its exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, its Dasha is called “Arohini” and it will give
full effects.</p>

<p>As regards the Dasha of a Grah in exaltation, friend’s
R&#257;&#347;i, or own R&#257;&#347;i, such Amsh, its
debilitation, or inimical R&#257;&#347;i, or, when a Grah is
eclipsed, it will give mixed effects and prove auspicious in the
second half.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya gives vitality to the Dasha effects, while Candr
regains the same. All other Grahas are known, as starry Grahas
and remain under the influence of S&#363;rya and Candr.</p>

<p>In the system of Nisargika Dasha, the Dashas of Grahas
follow, as under: Candr, Mangal, Budh, &#346;ukr, Guru,
S&#363;rya and &#346;ani and these prove auspicious in their
turns.</p>

<p>Though a Grah may be in evil R&#257;&#347;i, or evil Amsh, or
eclipsed by S&#363;rya, he will yield good results, if he has
potency to bestow. If he is in enemy’s Bhava, or Amsh, he will
under the circumstances, yield kingdom.</p>

<p>Notes: “Nisarga” means bestowing, or granting and hence a
liberal translation, as above is made. It has also been
translated, as Naisargika Dasha elsewhere. The reader is the
best judge.</p>

<p>The Grah placed in the Hora, or Navamsh of S&#363;rya will
give full effects, while the one in Candr’s Navamsh, or Hora, it
is only in a pipe dream, that the results mature.</p>

<p>Notes: Refer to Brihat Jataka, Ch. XXI, Slokas 4 and 5.
Malefic in solar Horas in odd R&#257;&#347;is make one famous,
engaged in big undertaking, powerful, wealthy and bright.
Similarly benefics in lunar Horas in even R&#257;&#347;i make
the person mild in disposition, brilliant in form, happy, lucky,
intelligent and sweet spoken. If malefics are in lunar Horas in
odd R&#257;&#347;is, or benefics in solar Horas in even
R&#257;&#347;is, the native is devoid of the respective
effects.</p>

<p>The Dasha of a Grah in Lagn, exaltation Bhava, own
R&#257;&#347;i, or own Dreshkan will be fully beneficial. The
effects of such a Grah placed in any Navamsh, as above will only
be mixed.</p>

<p>If at the start of a Dasha, Candr is posited in Kark, the
person will be harmed by a lady and kill cattle. In the Bhava of
Mangal, he will kill the landlord.</p>

<p>Notes: The details to work out the starting movements of
Dasha, or Bhukti are elaborately dealt with in the notes under
Sloka 18 of this Ch..</p>

<p>Should Candr (at the time of a commencement of a Dasha) be in
a R&#257;&#347;i owned by Budh, learning, proficiency in
Shastras and making new acquaintances are indicated. If it is
Guru’s R&#257;&#347;i, one begets comforts, residence and
respect.</p>

<p>In the Bhava of &#346;ukr, Candr gives (at the time of
commencement of a Dasha) enjoyment of food and drink galore,
comforts and destruction too. Should &#346;ani be the owner of
such a Bhava, the person derives pleasure through the woman he
married and does menial acts.</p>

<p>If Candr (at the time of commencement of a Dasha) be in Simh,
the native lives in impeccable forests, feels inclined to
torture others and quarrel with wife and son.</p>

<p>At the commencement of a Dasha, if the Dasha lord is in a
friendly Bhava, or exalted, or in an Upachaya Bhava, in a Kon,
or in Yuvati Bhava, there will be generally good results.</p>

<p>If Candr is in adverse Bhava (at the commencement of a Dasha)
the lord of the Dasha, though placed in exaltation (in the natal
horoscope) will not give good effects.</p>

<p>Authors, like Manitha, Keshava Daivagna, Mahadeva etc.,
suggest, that Candr’s good position at the moment of the
starting of a Dasha is necessary, in order that the Dasha Lord,
Bhukti Lord etc. bestow good results. This is in spite of the
fact, that the Grah concerned in the natus may not be that good.
Conversely, if Candr is not well placed at Dasha Prarambha Kala,
or Bhukti Prarambha Kala (i.e. commencement of Dasha, or
Bhukti), with well placed Dasha·Lord/Bhukti·Lord with reference
to the nativity, only adverse results will be felt. Keeping this
in mind, Prithu Yasas also suggests, that Candr should be well
placed at the commencement of a Dasha period. Unfortunately,
direct and sufficient stress is not made in this work on Udu
Dasha, or Vimshottari Dasha, as the Ch. concerned has only a
couple of Slokas and is placed at the end of the work. However,
Mantreswara attaches more and due significance to Udu Dasha and
places the particular Ch. at the head of the various Dashas in
his Phala Deepika. Does Prithu Yasas also feel otherwise, that
Udu Dasha is the most reliable, vide ch.31, Sloka 11? As Udu
Dasha is found more useful and is very popular, we ought to know
the mechanism of Dasha bhuktis and the method of finding out
Dasha/Bhukti Prarambha Kala. After finding out the exact moment,
when a Dasha, or Bhukti starts, a chart mapping the Grahas
should be erected, which should be read with the natus to get
more informative clues. Hence, I explain the same in this Ch.
itself, so that the reader can couple it with instructions from
all other sources. Without knowing commencing time of a period,
one cannot arrive at exact results.</p>

<p>Only after analysis of the said rules, a wise person should
predict good, or bad results.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 8<sup>th</sup> Ch. called Dasha Phala Nirupana
in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=9>Ch. 9. S&#363;rya’s Dasha</a></h2>

<p>During the period of S&#363;rya, the person lives in foreign
places, moves in forests and mountains and fortresses. Wealth
will be obtained through the sources of Brahmins, Gods, fire,
kings, Shastras and medicines.</p>

<p>The subject becomes proficient in pronouncing Mantras, expert
in obstruction, a king and heads an army. He will be intent upon
doing famous deeds, remains intelligent, has clear speech and is
undesirable. (“anishta” also means unlucky).</p>

<p>He becomes a killer of animals, snakes etc.  The Dasha will
deprive him of his wife, son and place of dwelling. He is
fickleminded and will be contracting debts; rash, eye disease
and disorders of abdomen, teeth and ears are indicated.</p>

<p>Danger from the king and thieves, enmity with relatives,
destruction of people of one’s own sect and of wealth are the
results of the Dasha of S&#363;rya. The consequences out of
S&#363;rya occupying various R&#257;&#347;is are explained below
in the context of his Dasha.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be exalted, in such Dasha, the person
becomes very courageous, intent upon doing such deeds, as
attributed to his birth (i.e. suitable to his own religion),
will be troubled by king’s men, inherits property from father
and becomes popular in the country.</p>

<p>When S&#363;rya has departed from his exaltation, in such
Dasha, he will cause abdominal disorders, diseases in head,
enmity with one’s own people and danger from quadrupeds.</p>

<p>Notes: “Uchchatikranta” has been interpreted, as above
because the author has specifically covered all the
R&#257;&#347;is. “Neechatikranta” has been interpreted as
“departed from the R&#257;&#347;i of fall” in Sloka 13 of this
Ch.. We may take them, as different from deep exaltation and
deep fall, respectively.</p>

<p>When S&#363;rya is in Vrishabh, his Dasha will deprive the
native of agriculture, cattle, son and wife. It gives trouble to
the physical heart, reproductive organs and eyes. Terms with
relatives will be strained. In any case, one’s prestige will not
be affected in such Dasha.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya in Mithun in his Dasha will confer deep interest
in Shastras, arts, poetry and sculpture. The subject will be
blessed with agriculture, cattle, money and grains and wealth
through his cousins.</p>

<p>When S&#363;rya occupies Kark, his Dasha will bring about
fame and royal money. He will be defeated by women. feeding
himself on the wind, i.e. fasting, separated from father and
relatives and be sharp in speech.</p>

<p>When S&#363;rya is in Simh, his own R&#257;&#347;i, this
gives in his Dasha all kinds of wealth and equals the subject to
a king. The subject lives in forts and forests, does
agriculture, lives with children and wife and earns fame in
abundance.</p>

<p>The Dasha of S&#363;rya in Kanya gives income through cattle,
Brahmins and Gods. Female issues are indicated. The subject
becomes world famous.</p>

<p>Notes: Female issues are specifically noted here, because the
R&#257;&#347;i Kanya is feminine.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be in his extreme debilitation, his Dasha
will bring about destruction in agriculture, issues, friends,
wealth and wife. The subject will go to foreign countries. Fear
from thieves and fire are also indicated.</p>

<p>The Dasha of S&#363;rya, that has departed from his fall,
gives wealth from kings and comforts there of. Grief caused out
of woman’s (wife’s) enmity and acquisition of wealth by cheating
others will also follow.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya is in Vrischik, in such Dasha, there will be
listlessness (in all affairs), danger from poison. water and
weapons and restriction (inaccessibility) to reach one’s
parents.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be in Dhanu, such Dasha begets pleasure
from one’s children and wife and gives plenty of money. The
subject is worshipped by Brahmins and kings and is happy through
Shastras, Vedas, music and musical instruments.</p>

<p>The Dasha of S&#363;rya in Makar will make the person engaged
in other’s work, deprived of one’s money and children and cause
misery through wives fault (or bad luck). The person suffers
from jaundice and loses a limb.</p>

<p>Notes: The loss of a limb will correspond to the one
indicated by Makar with reference to the natal Lagn. For
example:, if Lagn is Dhanu, the second R&#257;&#347;i indicates
face, eyes etc.</p>

<p>Heart diseases and loss of children will be caused by
S&#363;rya in Kumbh, when his Dasha operates. The native will
also be a tale bearer, eater of other’s foods and be hated by
his wife and relatives.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya is posited in Meen, his Dasha will give
respect, money and comfort, through one’s wife’s affection. The
native will suffer from remittent fever, will always think of
children and live, like a king.</p>

<p>The Dasha of S&#363;rya in Randhr Bhava, though in
exaltation, will only increase afflictions. S&#363;rya in Ari
Bhava will give in his Dasha ulcer, or wounds and no benefits
through parents.</p>

<p>Notes: The exaltation in Randhr Bhava for S&#363;rya occurs,
only when Kanya ascends. For Kanya, S&#363;rya is the lord of
Vyaya Bhava and his exaltation will increase his malefic
tendencies.</p>

<p>During the opening Dasha for a man, the good, or bad results
should be predicted (as it is). If, however, there are
combinations indicative of his death, the results for the Dasha
will not come to pass.</p>

<p>The results for the Dasha are subject to variation because of
the malefic deeds of parents. It is only after careful
evaluation of all the Yogas, should any predictions be
given.</p>

<p>If the native’s S&#363;rya is unfavourable to the parents the
Dasha of S&#363;rya will cause paralysis to the native.
Similarly with Lagn, when unfavourable to the parents, grief is
caused to the native in Lagn Dasha. Candr, when unfavourable to
the parents will obstruct the native’s learning in Candr’s
Dasha. This is true, only when any of the said Dashas is the
first one to the native.</p>

<p>Notes: Take the case of a Kumbh Lagn native, who has his
S&#363;rya in fall in Dharm Bhava. This is unfavourable to the
father. Such Dasha of S&#363;rya, according to this Sloka, will
cause paralysis to the native. Or a Simh native with Candr in
Bandhu Bhava is adverse to his mother. Such Candr’s Dasha will
cause hindrance to the native’s education. Or one of the parents
with Tula Lagn, while the son has Vrischik ascending are
mutually incompatible. And such Lagn will cause grief. In any
case, all the conditions in the Kundali should be taken into
consideration before asserting any results.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 9<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “S&#363;rya’s
Dasha” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=10>Ch. 10. Candr’s Dasha and its Effects</a></h2>

<p>Sage Manitha and others have normally classified the Dasha of
Candr in six categories. It is called (Arohini) (increasing),
when Candr is proceeding from the first day of the bright half.
It is Avarohini (or decreasing), when the period of the second
day of the dark half through New Candr prevails. Again it is
Arohini, when the birth takes place, if the waves of the ocean
are rising. Should the waves be depressed at the time of birth,
such Candr’s Dasha is Avarohini. It is also called Arohini, when
Candr has left his debilitation R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>Should Candr be departing from his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i,
it is called Avarohini Dasha. The ancient people have shown
three kinds of difference between Arohini and Avarohini.</p>

<p>Notes: The three kinds each of Avarohini are already
explained, from Slokas 1 to 4. Simultaneously, the three kinds
of Aroha Dashas are also explained. Thus, six categories are
made for Candr’s Dasha.</p>

<p>The three Aroha Dashas will bring about all-round success.
The person will become famous in the entire world. The three
kinds of Avaroha Dashas will only cause destruction. When Candr
has minimum strength, while all the Grahas are in lunar half of
the R&#257;&#347;is (though malefics in nature) good results
should be predicted. S&#363;rya in such a condition will prove
auspicious. Candr’s Dasha will make one a king’s minister and
acceptable to the king. He will be highly respected and will
acquire money through Gods, Brahmins and Mantras. He will be
modest and become expert in arts.</p>

<p>The native will acquire good and fragrant flowers, fruits and
trees (or fruit yielding trees), become famous, be very
valorous, will be on move at all times and will acquire wife and
children. He will be intelligent and wealthy.</p>

<p>He will worship Gods and Brahmins, help others and have good
mentally. He will be expert in dance and other arts. He will be
phlegmatic and windy in constitution.</p>

<p>The subject will have physical strength, will be hated by his
relatives, sleepy, lazy, intoxicated and without vigour.  The
foregoing are the results for Candr’s position in various
R&#257;&#347;is (in her Dasha).</p>

<p>The Dasha of Candr in Mesh will give gains of wife and
children. The native is intent on serving in foreign countries.
Loss of brother, acquisition of money through fair means and
disorder of head are also indicated.</p>

<p>If Candr is exalted, such Candr’s Dasha leads to acquiring a
kingdom. The subject will have sons, diamonds and be controlled
be wife (or women). He will also possess elephants, horses and
cows.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in Multrikon portion, the native in such
Dasha lives in foreign countries, gets money through
agriculture, or sales, hates his relatives and suffers from
diseases arising out of phlegmatic and windy defects.</p>

<p>If Candr is in the middle area of Vrishabh, in such Dasha,
highest happiness and lot of wealth will obtain. The native will
be among Brahmins, Gods and ministers and be liked by his
wife.</p>

<p>In the first half of the Dasha, death of mother will take
place and the native will indulge in sins. Should Candr be in
Vrishabh, in the second half of the Dasha, death of the father
will take place.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Candr in Mithun, the person will be engaged
in pleasing Brahmins and Gods, will be intelligent, will acquire
money, clothes and enjoyments. He will move from one place to
the other.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in Kark, in her Dasha, the native will earn
through lands, water, agriculture, cows and grains. He will
become well versed in Jyotish, will suffer from diseases in
rectum and will roam in forests, hills and forts.</p>

<p>When Candr is in Simh, in such Dasha, the native will acquire
knowledge and money. His desires will be fulfilled. He will be
considered superior among his men and be intelligent. He will
have loss of limbs and will not acquire many children. He will
be fortunate.</p>

<p>Notes: Simh being a dry R&#257;&#347;i, the progeny is
limited, depending on other conditions.</p>

<p>In Candr’s Dasha, when she is in Kanya, the native goes to
foreign countries. He acquires other women (or gains through
other women) and he will become expert in literature and arts.
He will achieve his objects and have little money.</p>

<p>When Candr is in Tula, her Dasha will cause afflictions
through wife, or women and loss of self respect. There will be
obstructions to his enthusiasm and he will become fickleminded.
He will suffer from poverty and grief.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in her debilitation R&#257;&#347;i, she may
cause death in her Dasha, or various kinds of illness. The
subject may also lose his wife. His enthusiasm will be broken
and he will regret for his own thoughts.</p>

<p>When Candr has just left her debilitation point, in such
Dasha, the native will lord a woman, who has limited wealth. He
will get money from sales and purchase. He will suffer from
diseases related to private parts. He will be attacked by
paralysis.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Candr in Dhanu, the subject lords over
elephants and horses and acquires many dwelling places.
Destruction to ancestral property will come to pass. The subject
will be happy in regard to his sons and become very rich.</p>

<p>Candr’s Dasha, when she is in Makar, will make the native
jealous, poor, live in a dancer’s house and will deprive of wife
and land. The native will become learned in Vedic Science, but
he will not have money and children.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Candr placed in Kumbh, one will resort to
menial professions, incur lot of debts, be fickleminded and
contact a women of bad character. He will suffer from diseases
in anus and stomach.</p>

<p>When Candr is in Vargothamamsh, she, in her Dasha, will cause
enmity with a mighty person and loss. The native will suffer
from diseases relating to teeth, eyes and ears. He will be
deserted by his sons and wife.</p>

<p>Notes: In the above Sloka, the Vargothamamsh refers to Candr
in Kumbh R&#257;&#347;i and Navamsh because after dealing with
Meen R&#257;&#347;i, Vargothamamsh in Meen is referred to in
Slokas 27 and 28 infra.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Candr in Meen, the native will enjoy money
through products of river and sea. He will be always on the move
and will be intelligent. He will have cows and buffaloes and be
in the company of his wife and children. He will conquer his
enemies.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in Vargothamamsh in Meen, in such Dasha, the
subject will gather treasures and have comforts. He will obtain
daughters and get some limbs damaged and lose his parents in
childhood.</p>

<p>Notes: The treasures may be specifically hidden under water,
as the R&#257;&#347;i Meen is a watery R&#257;&#347;i.  Should
the Dasha occur in one’s childhood, he will lose his parents.
Meen is a feminine R&#257;&#347;i and hence stress on female
issues is made. For Vrischik Lagn natives, more daughters are
possible depending upon the conditions in the Kundali.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Candr, who is in Vargothamamsh, the desires
relating to the previous R&#257;&#347;i will duly come to
mature. The subject will be chief of his men, intelligent,
strong, virtuous and very learned.</p>

<p>Notes: Suppose Candr is Vargothamamsh in Vrischik, then the
objects indicated by Tula, which is the previous R&#257;&#347;i,
will mature. So the subject will become a merchant, poet etc.,
as indicated by Tula. This is a very important clue and should
be made best use of wisely.</p>

<p>Should Candr be full and in Vyaya Bhava, in her Dasha, money
will be acquired in all ways. If, however, she be waning
inimically placed, or debilitated, the results mentioned will
decrease every moment.</p>

<p>Notes: Even though in Vyaya Bhava, if Candr is full, the
effects are good. Should she be in waning state, or placed in
inimical Bhava, or in fall, the results mentioned will mature in
a little way.  These two rules can be applied to not only
Candr’s Dasha, but to general predictive purpose.</p>

<p>Should Candr be waning and in Randhr Bhava, in such Dasha,
the native will be troubled with diseases. etc. Due to the
lapses of his wife (or women), he will face absolute penury.</p>

<p>In the period of Candr in fall in Randhr Bhava, the subject
will die, or frequently be sick. Should Candr, as above be yuti
with malefics, the subject will die, or be expelled from his
caste.</p>

<p>Should Candr be combust, in such Dasha, the subject is
deprived of his kingdom (or expelled from his country), faces
destruction and is subjected to grief. He suffers from diseases,
like jaundice and is subject to danger from water.</p>

<p>If the sixth Dasha belongs to waning (weak) Candr, the
subject destroys his own people. Should the said Candr be,
however, full, the person will get wealth only.</p>

<p>Notes: As per Sloka, the sixth Dasha lorded by Candr, who is
full, will lead only to financial upliftment and nothing else,
note the word Kevala in the text.</p>

<p>Should Candr occupy Lagn, in her Dasha, the person acquires
kingdom. In Karm Bhava, the person is blessed with daughters and
wealth. These are the results of Candr’s Dasha. Same effects
will be revealed, when she is in several Amshas.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 10<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Candr’s Dasha and
its Effects” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=11>Ch. 11. Mangal’s Dasha and its Effects</a></h2>

<p>Grahas placed in the first six R&#257;&#347;is, counted from
S&#363;rya, keep their faces downwards whilst those in the
remaining six R&#257;&#347;is keep their faces upwards. The
latter are capable of yielding good results.</p>

<p>The Dasha of Mangal will yield results in a medium way, as
though in exaltation, notwithstanding him having his face
downwards, or upwards, or his being in retrograde motion, or
Anuvakr (progressive). Results should be predicted after knowing
whether Grah is Vakr, or Anuvakr. For the five Grahas from
Mangal to &#346;ani (i.e. the starry Grahas) such evaluations
should be made.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal, the earning will be through fire,
lands, conveyances, medicines, indulging in lies, cheating and
carrying out various cruel activities. The person will suffer
from bilious diseases, bloody defects and fever. He will serve a
mean lady and be deserted by his sons, wife, relatives and
preceptors. He will have his eyes on the wealth of others.</p>

<p>If Mangal is in his Multrikon Bhava, in his Dasha, the native
will maintain to be in his caste and will acquire wife, children
and wealth. He will become valorous, fond of sexual acts and
intelligent.</p>

<p>When Mangal occupies Mesh, in his Dasha, the native will
become famous and enthusiastic. He will suffer from troubles
caused out of bile, will face risk of thefts and will be
subjected to much mental anguish.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal occupying Vrishabh, one will lose his
position, will contract diseases, grief and be fond of talking.
He will concentrate on other’s money and will have scant regards
for preceptor and Gods.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal in Mithun one will live in foreign
countries, or cities, will be very libidinous, will hate his own
relatives, will be subjected to much mental strain and will have
windy complaints.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Kark, the person will gain from water,
gardens and fire. He will be virtuous, deprived of wife, son and
relatives and he will lose his limbs and will cheat the
public.</p>

<p>When Mangal emerges from his depression region (in Kark) in
such Dasha, the person will become famous for his singular
virtues. He will be strong and chief against his enemies. He
will suffer from diseases in the anus. He will enjoy the wealth
of elephants and horses.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal posited in Simh, one will become
leader of masses and one will be enthusiastic. One will be
deprived of sons, wife and wealth and one will be troubled by
weapons and fire.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal in Kanya, the native gets position,
money and comforts. He will be an expert in organizing yagya’s
etc. He will be squint eyed; he will possess lands, wife and
children.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal posited in Tula, one will become
expert in knowing all facts and philosophies. He will get wealth
and grains from agriculture and he will hate his friends. He
will be killed by poison, fire, or weapons.</p>

<p>When the Dasha of Mangal posited in Dhanu starts, the person
gets wealth through Brahmins, Gods, kings etc. He does undo
things, promotes quarrels and enjoys great respect.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal, occupying his deep exaltation area,
the native commands comforts through vehicles, kingdom and
diamonds etc. His combat is not controllable (i.e. his eagerness
of purpose will be forceful, like that of a warrior) and he will
be chief of his folk.</p>

<p>If the Dasha of Mangal, who has departed his deep exaltation
zone and be in Makar, progresses, the subject will make serious
efforts to gather wealth and he will have troubles from
reptiles, animals and weapons. He will help the downtrodden and
will keep them happy.</p>

<p>When the Dasha of Mangal posited in Kumbh rules, the subject
will forsake his religious conduct, he will be proud, be
subjected to misery caused due to penury, he will take to bad
ways and also lose his issues.</p>

<p>Should Mangal be in Meen, in such Dasha, the native will be
sick, lose children and he will be troubled by heavy
expenditure. He will fall into debts, live in foreign places and
he will be afflicted by wounds etc.</p>

<p>When Mangal occupies the same R&#257;&#347;i and Navamsh, the
native will become world famous. The results of the Bhava, as
occupied by Mangal will be doubly felt. He will be a noted
person in the army and become strong.</p>

<p>Mangal, if in debilitation Amsh, makes the native in his
Dasha wander and unhappy. The good results, that are likely to
mature will be burnt. The person will give up good things and
run after bad ones.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of combust Mangal one will be worried with all
sorts of troubles and will be intent on destruction.  Should
Mangal be otherwise (i.e. not eclipsed, not fallen etc.) or, if
Mangal is placed in Bhavas relating to good Yogas, the effects
of the concerned R&#257;&#347;i will come to pass.</p>

<p>Should Mangal be in Randhr Bhava, there will be misconception
with one’s enemies, death and litigations. All kinds of
hindrances will occur for the sake of relatives, one’s prestige
will be at stake.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Mangal facing upwards, posited in exaltation,
or in Karm, or in Labh Bhava, the native acquires kingdom. He
will gain over his enemies, he will have many conveyances, army
(or followers) conquering neighbouring kingdoms and he will
enjoy wealth.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 11<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Mangal’s Dasha
and its Effects” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=12>Ch. 12. The Effects of Budh Dasha</a></h2>

<p>In the Dasha of Budh, one will distribute his knowledge (i.e.
be engaged in teaching etc.), one will be with relatives, earn
wealth through agriculture, yagya’s etc. and one will do his own
professing (befitting his birth).</p>

<p>He will be an expert sculpture and will master other allied
arts and will know music and enjoy vocal and instrumental music.
He will acquire all domestic vessels (i.e. he will be
well-equiped), conscientious and be an enthusiastic speaker.</p>

<p>He will love his partner, be modest, learned, acceptable to
his preceptors and he will suffer only to small extent from
diseases. He will be amidst his relatives and friends and be
prone to danger from weapons and the like.</p>

<p>He will be fortunate, he will not have wealth amassed, he
will be troubled by wind, phlegm and bile and he will be
distressed.</p>

<p>Following verses explain the results of Budh Dasha with
specific reference to individual R&#257;&#347;i and Amsh, as
described by the masters of the yester years.</p>

<p>Should the Dasha of Budh, who is in Mesh be in progress, the
native will have enthusiasm towards science, be intelligent,
valorous, indulge in lies, have no wealth, but have an eye on
other’s money.</p>

<p>When Budh is in Vrishabh, in such Dasha, the person will
prove unfavourable to his mother (or he will prove unlucky to
his mother). He will enjoy wealth and fame. He will also incur
debts for his relatives, he will have an ill-disposed wife and
children and he will suffer from throat diseases.</p>

<p>Should Budh be in Mithun, in his Dasha, the person acquires
many kinds of wealth and enjoys various pleasures. He will have
many children and wives. He will have two mothers, be dear to
his cousins and intelligent.</p>

<p>The person will be troubled by his relatives, keen to live in
distant countries and will have less comforts. He will acquire
money through poetry and arts.</p>

<p>These are the results for Budh Dasha, when the Grah is in
Kark.</p>

<p>When Budh is in Simh and his Dasha is in progress, the person
will be deprived of wisdom and wealth, will have no pleasure
through his brothers and relatives, he will hate women (or
wife), but he will be a celebrated person among the public.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Budh, who is in exaltation, one will
acquire wisdom and wealth. He will become a writer and he will
be interested in poetry. He will know politics and overcome his
foes.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Budh, who is in a Multrikon Bhava, one will
be famous and be interested in living in foreign countries and
will acquire wealth by virtue and vigour.</p>

<p>When Budh is in his own R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh, the
subject will become defective of a limb, he will have enmity
with his men and he will be deprived of pleasures, cattle and
wealth.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Budh, who is in Tula, the native will become
a good speaker and will develop deformity of the eyes. He will
not be peaceful. He will become an expert in sculpture etc. His
means of livelihood will be trading, or marketing. He will be
put to grief by elephants and horses.</p>

<p>When Budh is in Vrischik, in such Dasha, the subject will be
ready to accept whatever will be given (or donated) and will be
pleased even with an iota. He will develop illicit relationship
with an domestic servant. He will have troubles in this
household and he will suffer from penury.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Budh in Dhanu, the subject will become leader
of a group and Minister. He will acquire two names, i.e.  titles
etc. He will gather through agriculture, cattle and grains.</p>

<p>Should Budh be in Makar, the native will in such Dasha incur
debts, be inclined to do other’s work (i.e. at the disposal of
others), live in other countries, be on the move, be in the
company of mean people, be in the grip of illusions and have
physical pains.</p>

<p>When Budh is in Kumbh, in such Dasha, the brilliance of the
native will be affected and he will have limited food. He will
be penniless and he will be put to grief by his relatives. He
will have a wicked wife (or he may be head of a band of mean
women) and he will live in distant places.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Budh in Meen, the native will widely master
the meanings of the Ved, he will be inclined to give donations
and gifts and he will be chief of men and be dear to them.</p>

<p>When Budh is in his Neech R&#257;&#347;i, in such Dasha, one
will have mental agitation and will be deprived of his vitality
and relatives. He will earn his bread by husbandry, he will live
a trifling life, he will be afflicted by diseases and he will
live in other’s abodes.</p>

<p>Should Budh be in fall in the 8<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i,
in such Dasha, one will be troubled by poison, weapons and
quadrupeds. He will be intent on causing harm to the public at
all times and doing vicious deeds and he will have little
vitality.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of the combust Budh one will give up his landed
property, be subjected to mental depression, differ from
jaundice, cough etc. and one will destroy his wealth.</p>

<p>Should Budh be in his Vargothama position there will be both
auspicious and inauspicious events These effects may become two,
or three folds. Always there will be a mixture of good and
bad.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Budh, which is in Karm, or in Labh, or in
Bandhu Bhava, the results will be of mixed nature. The native
will get the leadership over his folk men. He will possess
knowledge, comforts, wealth etc. The Dasha of Budh
(notwithstanding his placement) will produce mixed results.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 12<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “The Effects of
Budh Dasha” in Horashara, the work of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=13>Ch. 13. The Effects of Guru Dasha</a></h2>

<p>In the Dasha of Guru one will be engaged in widely knowing
the meanings of the four Vedas; one will be intent upon
fulfilling the four Purusharthas (i.e. Dharm, Arth, Kama,
Moksh), one will be the chief of men and one will be extremely
intelligent.</p>

<p>During Guru Dasha, one will earn through education, worship
of Gods, medicines and performing of yagya’s. Due to the effect
of his birth, he will be blessed with the mercy of the king.</p>

<p>He will acquire horses and other conveyances, lands, clothes,
wife and children; he will be in the company of good men, chief
in his caste and he will get royal status.</p>

<p>He will minutely think before acting; he will be capable of
knowing the past, present and future; he will be apt in doing
wise acts and will suffer from diseases of the spleen, abscess
etc. and also disease relating to the upper limbs of the
body.</p>

<p>The foregoing results apply to Guru’s Dasha relating to his
position in various R&#257;&#347;is. Over and above, one should
predict the results after assessing individual R&#257;&#347;i
positions of Guru.</p>

<p>When Guru is in Mesh, in such Dasha, one will lead a group of
men, be wise, a king and one will have plenty of money.</p>

<p>Should Guru be in Vrishabh, in such Dasha, the native will be
troubled by his enemies and will suffer a lot of grief. He will
live in countries other than his own and his earnings will be by
means of little enthusiasm.</p>

<p>When Guru is in Mithun in his Dasha, one will hate women, be
wealthy and live through agriculture. He will hate his own
relatives and will prove and evil to his mother. He will also
become disabled in regard to some limb.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of the exalted Guru, the native will undertake a
profession suitable to his birth; he will be endowed with
kingdom, comforts and pleasure in an increasing manner and he
will have a spotless name. He will also be wealthy.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Guru, that has crossed his exaltation zone
(i.e. in Kark itself), the native will always roam; he will have
a wicked wife, his parents will be subjected to grief and the
native will sell away all his ancestral properties.</p>

<p>Should the Dasha of Guru, who is in Simh, be ruling, the
native will become a religious head and he will acquire wealth
through the sovereign. Due to his singular qualities, he will
get cattle, sons, wife etc.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Guru in Kanya, there will be money
through the king as well, as one’s own wife. He will have
quarrels with Sudras (the fourth caste) etc. and he will be
displaced. He will earn through cattle and increase his wealth.
He will have education, clothes and conveyances.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Guru in Tula, one’s enthusiasm will be
reduced; he will destroy his own wife and children (i.e. he may
not protect his wife and children); he will have severe ulcer
and day by day his eating will dwindle.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Guru in Vrischik one will be engaged in
divine work; one will be wandering, enthusiastic, indebted in
several ways and one will be interested in public and will be
principled.</p>

<p>Should the Dasha of Guru place in its Multrikon
R&#257;&#347;i be in progress, one will be important in the
public, a wise minister, a ruler of an area and acquire wealth
through women and be happy.</p>

<p>Should the Dasha of Guru posited in Dhanu be ruling, one will
get money through travels, be happy and be engaged in yagya’s;
one will possess cows and one will gather money from
husbandry.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Guru in his (deep) debilitation zone, one
will be grieved of his relatives, or vice versa, one will do
other’s jobs, suffer from poverty and from diseases relating to
belly, ears and private parts.</p>

<p>When the Dasha of Guru in Makar is in progress one will live
in forests and gain through hunters. He will also live by
agriculture and cheat Brahmins.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Guru in Kumbh, the native will earn money
by his own name and valour; he will be tale-teller, will live by
mean professions, will hate his people and will incur loss of
wealth.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Guru posited in Meen, one will be
principal among his men, will earn through education and
religious discourses; he will be liked by women and be
humble.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Guru in Vargothama Navamsh, one will be
worshipped by the public, acquire plenty of wealth and live in
the company, or his wife and sons. He will have an emaciated
physique.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of combust Guru, grief and happiness will be
equal. When the Grah in question is in fall, or is placed in
inimical R&#257;&#347;is, one will, in such Dasha, lose
children, wife and wealth and suffer from many diseases.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 13<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “The Effects of
Guru Dasha” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=14>Ch. 14. The Effects of &#346;ukr Dasha</a></h2>

<p>Now, the results of &#346;ukr Dasha, when the Grah is
occupying anyone of the various R&#257;&#347;is. The person
will, in the Dasha of &#346;ukr, acquire wife, ornaments,
clothes, happiness, pleasure, respect, honour and wealth.</p>

<p>He will become expert in the science dealing with sex, many
kinds of learning and he will be very intelligent. He will be

<p>He will be disposed to diseases arising our of windy,
phlegmatic and bilious shortfalls. He will derive great worries
our of his association with his brother’s son. He will have
enmity with mean people and be pitiable because of his departure
from the right path.</p>

<p>Now, the effects of the Dasha of &#346;ukr posited in Mesh in
each R&#257;&#347;i are described below. The auspicious results
should be mentioned only after knowing whether the
R&#257;&#347;is/Navamshas are inimical, or fallen.</p>

<p>When the Dasha of &#346;ukr posited in Mesh is in progress,
one will derive pleasure from his wife (or women). He will lose
money and honour. He will be on the move, intolerant, live with
little means, be of lordly nature and a favourite of a
princess.</p>

<p>The person, who has the Dasha of &#346;ukr posited in
Vrishabh, will be engaged in husbandry, possess cattle and wife
and be intelligent. He will be versed in many Shastras (Vedic
sciences) and a donor to good causes. He will get female issues
and he will be favoured by the king.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of &#346;ukr, who is posited in Mithun, one will
be busy with many activities in surprising tales and very
enthusiastic. He will be interested in surprising tales and
living abroad. He will be wealthy.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ukr in Kark, the subject will be
engaged in his work; he will have two wives, be virtuous and he
will have many kinds of living.</p>

<p>When &#346;ukr is in Simh, in such Dasha, one will acquire
wealth through a distinguished woman and one will aim at others’
money. He will be intelligent, have limited issues and his
cattle will be destroyed.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be in Kanya, in such Dasha, one will not
have happiness in pursuing his ancestral professions and his
enthusiasm will diminish. He will be fickle-minded, intent on
living abroad and he will be given up his wife.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of Vargothama &#346;ukr, one will be
troubled by kings and thieves. He will be unhealthy and weak.
His food will be by begging and he will be roaming.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of &#346;ukr in Tula, the native will acquire a
name of high order. He will gain through agriculture, cattle,
grains etc. and wealth from the wise.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of &#346;ukr posited in Vrischik, the subject
will be wandering, uttering too much, interested in other’s
work; he will promote disputes and incur debts in large
scale.</p>

<p>When &#346;ukr is in Dhanu, in such Dasha, the native will
eradicate his enemies, become the chief among his caste men and
will be respected. He will be an adept poet, dear to the
sovereign and he will be happy with his wife and sons.</p>

<p>When the Dasha of &#346;ukr posited in Makar opens, one will

principal person in his dynasty, earn wisdom, become a king and
be wealthy. He will acquire money through agriculture. He will
possess pleasing physique and will come to prominence.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ukr, who is Vargothama in Meen, one
will possess self-respect, suffer from sickness and establish
irrigation facilities for the public.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be in his exaltation Bhava, or in Vyaya, or
in Karm, or in Labh Bhava and be not in the company of malefics
and be free from such dristhis, in such Dasha, the native will
beget various diamonds, be wise, have broad eyes and be the
chief of his dynasty.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 14<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “The Effects of
&#346;ukr’s Dasha” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=15>Ch. 15. The Effects of &#346;ani Dasha</a></h2>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani, the native will acquire fame,
intelligence and knowledge of many Shastras. He will become
leader of a group, a village, or a city. He will be more famous
than his father and will be versed with all religious
commandments.</p>

<p>He will have elephants, horses, cows and wealth and he will
obtain the wealth of his cousins. He will have respect for
Brahmins and Gods and will live in an old house. He can be
pleased with an iota of things.</p>

<p>He will be drowsy in disposition and capable of hard work. He
will be hated by men and he will be interested in women, who are
older than him. He will like to be virtuous, be modest and be
interested in the jobs of Gods. i.e. temples etc.</p>

<p>The subject will have windy and phlegmatic deficits. He will
incur defect in limbs and become weak. These results, as
aforesaid are only general in nature. For each R&#257;&#347;i
and Amsh the following details may be noted.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani in Mesh, one will be taken away
from his residence, without a job, independent in nature; one
will suffer skin diseases in foot etc.; one will be cunning in
nature and will be deprived of his coborn and relatives.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of &#346;ani, who has just left his debilitation
zone, one will get grains through agriculture, but will be
grieved by fall (from high places); one will be equal to the
least and not enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Vrishabh, in such Dasha, one will get
titles, be very intelligent, become a king, or his equal, serve
in a war and one will show too much of interest in doing
virtuous acts.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani in Mithun, the native will be
impatient, will enjoy children, wealth and happiness, but he
will lose through women and thieves. He will be keen to do the
jobs of others and will be troubled through battles.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani in Kark, one will be worried
and dependent upon others; one will be deprives of mother,
children and relatives; one will grow short of sight and
hearing, but be intelligent.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Simh R&#257;&#347;i, or in Simh
Navamsh, in such Dasha, one will be subjected to various
diseases, one will develop misunderstandings with sons, wife and
relatives and will command wealth through cows, buffaloes,
horses etc.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani posited in Kanya, the native
will attain learning and will produce (money) by his labour.  He
will have fear from Brahmins and water. But he will be dear to
preceptors, Brahmins, Yogis etc.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani, who is in his exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, one will gain wisdom and wealth. People will
regard his learning. Naturally money will come to him and he
will have happiness.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of &#346;ani in Vrischik, one will kill, or
capture insects, will wander aimlessly, speak untruth, will not
be kind (to others) and will remain at the mercy of mean people
for his livelihood.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of &#346;ani posited in Dhanu, one will enjoy
health, be respected by the sovereign, or be a king himself; one
will acquire money through profession, or creatures; one will be
with sons and wife and will be active, as though in a war
front.</p>

<p>When &#346;ani occupies Makar, in such Dasha, one will have
money by putting abundant labour, will be fortunate, dear to
barren, or older ladies and lose money through the confidence he
reposes (in others).</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in his Multrikon Bhava, in such Dasha,
one will derive comforts. He will be chief among his caste men.
He will be wise and wealthy through agriculture, cattle and
grains. He will have sons.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Meen, in such Dasha, one will acquire
money only with slight enthusiasm. He will head a group of
villages in the city and he will be desirous of young women and
at the same time final emancipation.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be combust, in such Dasha, one’s income and
expenditure will be in equal ratio; one will be unhappy,
sometimes fraudulent, one will be widely famous, but be
afflicted by worries.</p>

<p>The results for R&#257;&#347;i and Amsh positions have thus
been said and the predictions should be based on whichever is
stronger. Should they be equal in strength one should assume
balanced results.</p>

<p>These are the results of various Dashas of the Grahas. One
should fully understand the native before predicting the events
and predict accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 15<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “The Effects of
&#346;ani Dasha” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=16>Ch. 16. Miscellaneous Dasha Effects</a></h2>

<p>If the Grah is of a mixed nature, in such Dasha, the results
relating to one’s house, or abode and to one’s happiness and
money will only be weak. He will have a tendency to live in
others’ houses, be respected by the public and learned.</p>

<p>During the Dasha of a Grah, that is in his retrograde motion,
one will have prestige and valour and be wealthy. Should the
Grah be in a good R&#257;&#347;i, or good Navamsh, avoiding Ari
and Randhr Bhava, one will acquire a kingdom of his own.</p>

<p>Should a Grah be in debilitation, or in inimical Bhavas, at
the same time being in its retrograde motion, in such Dasha, one
will indulge in bad acts; one will be reviled by his relatives;
one will live in foreign countries and one will be dependant
upon others.</p>

<p>During a sub-period of Rahu Dasha, when Rahu is placed
between (malefic) Grahas, there will be extreme grief for 2
years. Should a sub-period and an inter-sub-period be of two
mutually inimical Grahas, one will be deprived of his relations
and suffer from diseases.</p>

<p>Even though a Grah by nature be auspicious, it yields only
inauspicious results, if it is in the company of Rahu. In the
end of such Dasha, one will be exposed to diseases grief and
displacement.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of a Grah, that is inimical to Lagn’s lord, or
the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i, one will be wandering, banned
from his country (or lose his kingdom) and will be insulted by
enemies, when seeking their protection.</p>

<p>Even good Grahas will produce malefic results in their Dashas
in the event of their occupying inimical, or debilitational
Bhavas, or Ari of Vyaya Bhava from Lagn. The Grahas, that are
placed in inauspicious Bhavas will also give bad results.</p>

<p>If &#346;ukr in in his own Bhava identical with Randhr Bhava,
he makes one sick, should he also join malefics in such
condition, at the end of &#346;ukr Dasha, death is caused.
Should Lagn’s lord be in Randhr Bhava, yuti with malefics, he
inflicts death in his Antar Dasha.</p>

<p>The Dasha of Randhr’s lord posited in a Kendr will prove
auspicious. Should he be, while being so, eclipsed, or yuti with
Rahu, according to the wise, death is inflicted upon the
native.</p>

<p>Should there be doubts about Lagn’s lord, or a Grah in Randhr
Bhava killing the native, it happens only at the end of the
Dasha of the said Grah.</p>

<p>Those, that are in own R&#257;&#347;is, or in exaltation
R&#257;&#347;is, if in a Kendr, or in the 11<sup>th</sup> Bhava
to another Grah, they become Karakas, or the latter. The Grah,
which occupies the 10<sup>th</sup> Bhava of the Grah referred
to, as latter, it assumes special importance.</p>

<p>If the Karm’s lord is placed in a Kendr, he becomes a
signifier of the earlier mentioned Grah. Lords of Karm and Dharm
Bhava, if posited in a Kendr give good results.</p>

<p>The Karakatwa Grah (as above) makes one a principal person in
his caste. In such Dasha without doubt, the native’s desires
would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Should the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i, or Lagn’s lord be in
a Kendr along with Guru the native is happy in the middle
portion of his life.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of a Grah posited in a malefic’s Navamsh, the
native faces hindrance to his education in the boyhood.  Should
the said Navamsh be of a combust Grah, the said effect is
undoubtedly certain.</p>

<p>Should the Grahas commencing from Mangal onward be in their
respective exaltation R&#257;&#347;is, or in own
R&#257;&#347;is, coinciding with Kendras and be strong, five
kinds of Yogas, viz. Ruchaka, Bhadr, Hamsh, Malavya and Shasha
Yogas are produced.</p>

<p>If these are considered, not relating to other Yogas, these
are capable of giving repeated and full effects to the persons
born in superior families.</p>

<p>Those, that are born with these Yogas (i.e.  any of the 5
Yogas mentioned above) enjoy wealth on a perennial basis, fame
and are illustrious, meritorious and become king of kings. Such
men command elephants, horses, various diamonds and a long
life.</p>

<p>Those, who have S&#363;rya and Candr weak, while others from
Mangal are also weak, do not become kings. They shall only have
sons and money.</p>

<p>According to Brahma Sounda, one with superior Yogas lives
with happiness and wealth. Adverse combinations will only
produce inauspicious effects.</p>

<p>Anything started in the Dasha of a Grah, that has been out of
its exaltation (i.e. in fall speak to broadly) will only not
mature. The Dasha of the Grah ruling the 6<sup>th</sup> (or the
8<sup>th</sup>) counted from the Bhava occupied by Lagn’s lord
will cause death, if the said Grah is debilitated.</p>

<p>Should a malefic (untoward) Grah be in Ari, or Randhr Bhava
and not receiving Drishti from Grahas posited in good Bhavas, he
brings death by disease, travel etc.</p>

<p>The Grahas Guru, &#346;ukr, &#346;ani, Mangal and Budh their
representative characters of elements (i.e. Panch Bhutas) viz.
Akash, Jal, Vayu, Tejas and Prithivi in their Dashas through
wind, bile and phlegm. Grahas mixed in nature yield mixed
results.</p>

<p>Among men, animals and birds the lustre of the body,
indicating both inauspicious and auspicious effects and the good
qualities of the inner mind, the brilliant qualities etc. can be
seen by the learned, as the flame of a lamp kept in crustal
vessel.</p>

<p>Prithivi’s lustre gives teeth, skin nail and hair, adds
fragrance, satisfaction, money, gain and upward status and makes
one virtuous.</p>

<p>Jal is glossy, white (like camphor), green (like grass),
pleasing to the eyes and indicates amiable nature and qualities,
comforts, growth, protects, like mother, and indicates all-round
prosperity.</p>

<p>Tejas is disposed to anger, is, like lotus, gold and burning
fire, shining, capable of conferring success and fulfilling of
all desires.</p>

<p>Vayu is non-white i.e. black, cloudy, of bad smell, is
secretive, dusty, rough and capable of causing grief. It causes
sufferance, gives no wealth and destroys one’s parental
properties.</p>

<p>One born under the influence of Akash, can know the words and
meanings and study those deeply. He is conscientious and
respected, has loose joints, weak hands and legs and the nature
of sky. He is tall in stature.</p>

<p>The effects produced by weak Grahas are only pipe dreams. The
effects of Panch Maha Purush Yogas, if the Grahas are weak,
should be deduced similarly.</p>

<p>Only after estimating one’s physical appearance, caste,
qualities etc., the results should be declared according to
family, country, age etc. in the order of the Dashas
concerned.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 16<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Miscellaneous
Dasha Effects” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=17>Ch. 17. The Effects of Ashtak Varg</a></h2>

<p>The following are the Ashtak Varg places in the several
Ashtak Vargas of S&#363;rya and other Grahas: Benefic dots from
Lagn, S&#363;rya etc. should be marked on the ground (nowadays
on paper) and added together. The Dasha effects arising out of
the 12 R&#257;&#347;is should be determined for the several
Grahas. In the Dashas of the Grahas, which contain no benefic
dots, or, which are placed in fall, or in an enemy’s Bhava will
bring about diseases, financial loss, grief etc. If there are
one, two, or three dots only, predict loss of money, grains and
cattle. With four dots, the effects are medium, i.e. not bad and
not good. Should there be five dots, all desires will be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>The results relating to a Grah in own Bhava, in exaltation
Bhava, or in Upachaya Bhava should be deduced, as told above.
The results arising out of benefic dots (in each Ashtak Varg)
should be understood, as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>The goods delivered be good Bhavas will be of twofold
auspicious. Should it be otherwise, the results are also
otherwise.  In such manner, the results of the 12 Bhavas
commencing from Lagn should be deduced.</p>

<p>The physical growth, possessing limbs, or otherwise should be
known from Lagn. Truthfulness, prudence and wealth are to be
known from the second Bhava. One’s voice, strength, courage and
co-born should be estimated from the third Bhava. One’s comforts
(happiness), relatives, mental disposition and mother should be
assessed from the fourth Bhava. One’s nature, extent of mental
calibre and sons are to be known from the fifth Bhava. The sixth
Bhava helps to know about one’s cousins, enemies, wounds etc.
The seventh Bhava should be consulted in respect of one’s
progenic ability, marital success etc. The eighth Bhava reveals
diseases, death etc. The ninth Bhava is called Bhagya Sthan
(luck), Guru Sthan (elders and preceptors) and Dharm Sthan
(virtues). The tenth Bhava speaks of one’s profession, living,
courage, prowess, learning and fame (seen and heard). One’s
wealth, monetary gains etc. should be known from the eleventh
Bhava. The twelfth Bhava is known, as the Bhava of expenses and
sins. This is how a wise Jyotishi should assess the twelve
Bhavas.</p>

<p>Whichever Bhavas are occupied by malefics, will yield
unpleasant results. Benefics cause fruition of the Bhavas they
occupy. Grahas of mixed disposition will give mixed results.</p>

<p>Even though a Grah is bad by nature, should it be in a
friendly, or exalted R&#257;&#347;i, only auspicious results
will be felt. Similarly benefics in inimical Bhavas, or in fall,
will turn bad and give bad effects.</p>

<p>Only after assessing the effects, as above, one should
predict the various events. One’s own ability to influence (the
matter in the world) and about his father should be known from
S&#363;rya.</p>

<p>His mind, the extent of wisdom and about his mother should be
known from Candr. Mangal rules brother, Sattva Gun and landed
property.</p>

<p>Awareness, speech, act and wisdom are under Budh. His
physical soundness, wisdom, sons and wealth are governed by
Guru.</p>

<p>&#346;ukr governs his marriage (and that, which he is bound
to perform in his family) and the pleasures out of marriage and
conveyances. His longevity, means of livelihood and death are
governed by &#346;ani.</p>

<p>Should the Grahas be devoid of strength at birth, the effects
they generate will be equally weak. This does not, however,
apply to &#346;ani. The reverse holds good in his case.</p>

<p>The effects revealed by the various Bhavas will be in
proportion to the benefic dots in the Bhavas occupied by them.
The results of the Dashas cannot be estimated without such
Ashtak Varg Kundalis.</p>

<p>Take the Ashtak Varg Kundali of S&#363;rya and find out the
benefic dots. The R&#257;&#347;i, which is ninth from the
R&#257;&#347;i occupied by S&#363;rya is related to one’s
father. The Shodhya Pind should be multiplied by the said figure
of benefic dots and the resultant figure should be divided by
27. When &#346;ani transits the particular asterism, as denoted
by the remainder in the above process will cause death of the
native’s father. The stars in Kon position to the earlier
mentioned star will also function similarly. It should be a
Chidra Dasha to cause such an effect.</p>

<p>The transit of &#346;ani in the 9<sup>th</sup> R&#257;&#347;i
from Candr R&#257;&#347;i may also cause the native lose his
father. For this, either Dasha of S&#363;rya, or Candr should
also be in simultaneous operation.</p>

<p>Note the lord of the Navamsh holding the 4<sup>th</sup> lord.
In the Dasha of the said Navamsh lord, the native’s father may
die.  Alternatively, death of father can occur in the Dasha of
the lord of the fourth Bhava.</p>

<p>Note the owner of the eighth Bhava from the ninth Bhava (i.e.
Bandhu Bhava). When such Dasha of a Grah posited in Lagn, the
native shall and at no time later than that, perform the last
rites of his father.</p>

<p>The native’s mother has the same fate (of passing away) in
the Dasha of the 9<sup>th</sup> lord posited in the eleventh
Bhava, or in Lagn. It has special effect, if this counting is
done from Candr R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>Thus, would the native complete the obsequies of his father
(and mother), if any undone. Should one be born in the
3<sup>rd</sup> Bhava of the father’s Lagn, he will inherit
paternal money.</p>

<p>One born in a Lagn, which is tenth from that of the father,
will acquire such qualities, which are equal to his father’s.
Even, if the lord of such R&#257;&#347;i occupies Lagn, the
native will be superior to the father.</p>

<p>Note the R&#257;&#347;i, which has no Bindus in S&#363;rya’s
Ashtak Varg. The month indicated by the particular
R&#257;&#347;i should be avoided for negotiating marriage and
other such auspicious functions.</p>

<p>Such months corresponding to the R&#257;&#347;is without
Bindus may give rise to disputes, tiredness, grief etc.  One
should act after knowing such effects.</p>

<p>The Shodhya Pind of S&#363;rya’s Ashtak Varg should be
multiplied by the number of benefic dots in Randhr Bhava and
divided by 12. The death of the native may take place in the
month counted from Mesh, or its Kon, as represented by the
remainder.</p>

<p>If Candr is in transit in a R&#257;&#347;i, without benefic
dots, in her Ashtak Varg, such Nakshatras should be avoided for
good events.</p>

<p>When Candr transits the Nakshatras in the 8<sup>th</sup> from
the natal position, or its Konas, she will cause worry, sickness
and grief.</p>

<p>The Shodhya Pind should be multiplied by the number of dots
in the 4<sup>th</sup> Bhava from the natal Candr and divided by
27. The remainder represents the asterism, in which &#346;ani’s
transit proves unfavourable to the mother. Even the Kon stars
may cause the event.  Should there be Dasha Chidra at that time,
the event may take place.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in the 4<sup>th</sup> from natal Candr,
or give a Drishti to it (from the 7<sup>th</sup>, or the
10<sup>th</sup>), at a time before noon, it indicates death of
the native, or travel to a distant place.</p>

<p>Note the Navamshas occupied by the lords of the
4<sup>th</sup> and the 8<sup>th</sup> from Candr. S&#363;rya’s
transit in a Kon from there indicates mother’s death in that
particular month. The same is to be deducted from Lagn of the
father. The issues related to one’s mother should be evaluated
in the same way, as done for the father.</p>

<p>Brother’s wealth. etc., are to be understood from the Ashtak
Varg of Mangal. Should Mangal be weak, one acquires learning
with difficulty.</p>

<p>In the Ashtak Varg of Budh reductions should be made (as
suggested). The R&#257;&#347;i indicated by the remainder, when
transited by &#346;ani will guide about loss of sons, friends
and such other events without any doubt.</p>

<p>The numbers of issues one can have should be guessed from the
Ashtak Varg of Guru. Note the benefic dots in the 5<sup>th</sup>
from Guru and eliminate the dots contributed by Grahas posited
in enemy’s Bhava and in fall. The net dots there after will
reveal the number of issues possible. Again, the number of
Navamshas passed by Guru, or the lord of Putr Bhava.</p>

<p>Note the dots in total in the Ashtak Varg of Guru. The dots
in the R&#257;&#347;is occupied by malefics should not be
considered. The balance left out equals the number of issues,
while the dots in the Vyaya, Randhr and Putr Bhava, if occupied
by malefics, will indicate the number of children to die.</p>

<p>Putr Bhava from Lagn and the 5<sup>th</sup> Bhava from Guru
should have more than 3 dots in the Ashtak Varg of Guru.
Otherwise, one will be issueless. However, if these Bhavas are
receiving Drishtis from, or are occupied by their lords, this
rule does not apply and the native will have children.</p>

<p>With these guidelines the question of issues can be answered.
Should the Kundali be indicative of children being obtained, it
will happen accordingly. The rules for destruction of family,
i.e.  issuelessness, are separately detailed.</p>

<p>Note the benefic dots (in Sarvastha Varg) of &#346;ukr
contributed by various Grahas. Then, the Kon reduction should be
done (as per rule explained already) and after that Ekadhipathya
reduction (for the Grahas owing two R&#257;&#347;is each except
for S&#363;rya and Candr) should be made. Time for obtaining
lands, wife and wealth should be predicted according to the
R&#257;&#347;is having benefic dots. Wife in particular should
be ascertained from Yuvati Bhava with reference to the position
of &#346;ukr (at birth).</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;i occupied by the lord of the Navamsh, in
which Yuvati’s lord is posited will denote Candr R&#257;&#347;i
of the native’s wife. It may also correspond to the exaltation,
or own Bhava of Yuvati’s lord. Some Rishis mention, that the
ninth Bhava counted from Candr, or from Lagn may indicate the
Janm R&#257;&#347;i of the wife. The wise should suitably
understand the issue.</p>

<p>Should the Janm R&#257;&#347;i of the wife be other than the
ones mentioned above, it is indicative of no progeny. (This is a
very important clue to match the horoscopes, when issues are
felt to be an essential outcome to follow marriage). The dots in
Yuvati and in Dharm Bhava will indicate the number of women one
will attain. This is trebled in the case of R&#257;&#347;i and
double in the Navamsh.</p>

<p>One will sexually gain low class women, if &#346;ukr is in a
Navamsh of &#346;ani, or in such R&#257;&#347;i, or in a
malefic’s company. The person will violate the marital bonds in
regard to sexual union, if &#346;ukr is in a R&#257;&#347;i of
Navamsh of Mangal, or yuti with, or Drishti to Mangal.</p>

<p>Should Yuvati Bhava in Navamsh be that of &#346;ani, or
Mangal (i.e. Kark, Simh, Vrishabh, or Tula rising in the Navamsh
Kundali) the native’s wife will be a prostitute, or at least an
adulteress. This is doubtless.</p>

<p>One will be displaced through a woman, if Candr occupies
Yuvati, or Vyaya Bhava, at the same time in the Amsh of a
malefic Grah, while &#346;ukr is yuti with a malefic.</p>

<p>The female of the native will be representative of the
Navamsh occupied by &#346;ukr, in complexion, appearance and
disposition, or the Navamsh occupied by the lord, or the
9<sup>th</sup>, or the 7<sup>th</sup> will also give such clues.
One should assess the strength and weakness of such positions
and predict about the wife of the native.</p>

<p>The Ashtak Varg of &#346;ani should be prepared by inserting
the auspicious dots in all the 12 R&#257;&#347;is. Add the dots
in the R&#257;&#347;is between Lagn and &#346;ani on one hand,
between &#346;ani and Lagn on the other hand. These two figures
will reveal the age, at which the subject will have diseases and
grief. When these two are totalled, it indicates the possible
year of death.</p>

<p>The reductions suggested should be done to arrive at the
Shodhya Pind of &#346;ani’s Ashtak Varg. This should be
multiplied by the number of dots in Randhr Bhava and be divided
by 27. The quotient will represent the longevity of the native
in years. From the remainder, one can work our the months, days,
Ghatikas etc. Should there be Dasha Chidra at the time so
arrived, death is certain.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;is, which have no dots in &#346;ani’s Ashtak
Varg are productive of destruction. The Shodhya Pind mentioned
in S.69 should be divided by 12. When Candr transits the
R&#257;&#347;i represented by the remainder, death of the native
will take place.</p>

<p>A diagram should be made by putting the various benefic dots
together in their respective R&#257;&#347;is (i.e.  Sarvashta
Varg Kundali) and ascertaining from the rising degree the bad,
good and neutral (i.e. not bad, but not good) one should know
the results of the Dashas and suggest suitable time for journey,
marriage etc.</p>

<p>The effects of various kinds may be known through the
Sarvashtak Varg etc. Otherwise, it is not possible to ascertain
good and bad of the effects.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;is, which have 30, or more dots are capable
of giving good results, while the ones having 25-30 dots are
medium in effects.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;is, or Bhavas with very little number of
dots will yield very harmful results. All other R&#257;&#347;is
are good and auspicious acts should be performed (when related
Grahas travel in such R&#257;&#347;is).</p>

<p>One should choose such R&#257;&#347;is, which have more
benefic dots for auspicious acts. Should Lagn have more dots
than Vyaya Bhava, one will enjoy life and be wealthy. If it is
otherwise, penury will doubtlessly result. Up to 30 his life
will have medium good, afterwards it will be indeed good.</p>

<p>The wise Jyotishi should assess the effects of the Bhavas
from Lagn through Vyaya Bhava. The more the benefic dots, it is
good. If the dots are less, it will only inflict
afflictions.</p>

<p>Barring Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava, the results for other
Bhavas should be deducted in the above manner.</p>

<p>From Meen to Mithun, it is called first Khanda (or division),
while the second Khanda starts form Vrischik and ends with
Kumbh. From Kark to Tula, it is the third Khanda. These Khandas
are to be kept separately, as functions relating to age will
have to be effected at appropriate times.</p>

<p>Whichever Khanda has more benefic dots will give auspicious
results, while the one with least number of dots will give
inauspicious results. Only after noting this, the Dasha results
should be declared. (If a Dasha lord is in a Khanda with maximum
dots, good results follow) The Khanda with more malefics will
give malefic results, while the one with benefics will give
benefic results. If both malefics and benefics are these, mixed
results will be felt. Only after examining the 3 Khandas the
Dasha results should be declared.</p>

<p>The total number of dots from Lagn to the R&#257;&#347;i
occupied by &#346;ani should be added together and multiplied by
7 and divided by 27. The remainder reveals the year, which will
cause grief and sickness to the native.</p>

<p>The same procedure should be applied for the positions, as
under: 1. from &#346;ani to Lagn; 2. from Mangal to Lagn; 3.
from Lagn to Mangal. In such years, as revealed by the
remainders, difficulties, like grief, tiredness and diseases
will surely follow.</p>

<p>Add the Navamshas of &#346;ani and Lagn.  The year
represented by this figure will cause hurt by weapon.</p>

<p>In the way explained above process add the Navamshas of Rahu
and Lagn on the one hand and Mangal and Lagn on the other hand.
The years indicated thus will cause some accident, wound by
weapons, tiredness, grief etc. Thus, Navamsh arrived similarly
between an auspicious Grah and Lagn will give good results like,
sons, wealth, happiness etc. in particular years without any
doubt.</p>

<p>Note in what number of Navamsh the 8<sup>th</sup> lord is
placed. This figure should be multiplied by the benefic dots in
Randhr Bhava (Sarvashtak Varg Kundali) and divided by 12. When
S&#363;rya in Gochara touches the Bhava represented by the
remainder, the death of the native may take place, or he will be
attacked by diseases. Similar results should be guessed from
Pitru Sthan and Matru Sthan (Dharm and Bandhu Bhava) for father
and mother, respectively.</p>

<p>Add the benefic dots in the 12 R&#257;&#347;is, commencing
from left to right and group them in four, according to the four
directions. There will be good from such direction indicated by
the group with the maximum number of dots. A benefic in such
position will make the effects intensive. One should always
avoid such direction with less dots.</p>

<p>Construction of a cattle shed, dealing in lands, agriculture
etc., if done in a good R&#257;&#347;i, will prove beneficial.
Any money invested, or deposited in an inauspicious
R&#257;&#347;i will only vanish. (These are to indicate
S&#363;rya’s travel in such R&#257;&#347;is with more, or less
dots in the Ashtak Varg Kundali) In the direction indicated by
the lord of Dhan Bhava, there will be gain of wealth. In
Randhr’s lord’s direction, there is bad luck only.</p>

<p>The wise Siddhasena dealt with Ashtak Varg in greater length
and I have presented this briefly.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 17<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Effects of Ashtak
Varg” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=18>Ch. 18. Effects of Dashas and Antar Dashas of the
Grahas</a></h2>

<p>While dealing with the results of sub-periods (or Antar
Dashas) in a Dasha, it should be noted, that the results differ
from the ones stated for the Dashas already. The results for
Dashas and Antar Dashas should be studied before giving
prediction on events.</p>

<p>Should the lord of the Dasha be yuti with an other Grah, the
latter will possess half of the Dasha of the former one. The
ones in the fifth, or the ones in the ninth form the Dasha lord
will enjoy one third; the Grah(as) in the seventh from the Dasha
lord will have one seventh of the Dasha and the ones in the
fourth and the eighth will get one fourth.</p>

<p>The Grahas placed, as stated above with reference to the
Dasha lord will only take part (in the rulership) in the whole
of the Dasha scheme. If Rahu is in Lagn, the effects of the
Dasha will be marred.</p>

<p>If the luminaries (i.e. S&#363;rya and Candr) are yuti with
Rahu, then their sub-period is increased by another half.  In
such case, S&#363;rya and Candr give such results, like
&#346;ani and none else. This is the view of some earlier
writers.</p>

<p>The Dasha period of a Grah should be converted into Ghatis
and multiplied by 84. The product should be increased in
proportion to the longitude attained by the Grah (in the
partient, or Bhava).  The results of Antar Dashas will be
similar in nature, as applicable to the major lord, i.e.
malefic, benefic and medium.</p>

<p>The Antar Dasha results will depend on the Dasha lords, when
these belong to S&#363;rya, Candr, &#346;ani and Guru. As for
the rest, the strongest from a Kendr will be a guiding
factor.</p>

<p>In the sub-period of Candr in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, the
native will have friends, money pleasures and wealth. Should the
Dasha be adverse, one will face risks from water and suffer,
from white leprosy, dysentery and consumption.</p>

<p>In S&#363;rya’s Dasha, when the sub-period of Mangal rules,
one will acquire gold, gems etc. He will be famous and
courageous and suffer from bilious diseases and also
shortcomings of digestive fire of the stomach.</p>

<p>In Budh’s sub-period of S&#363;rya’s Dasha, there will be
skin diseases. One will become famous and enthusiastic. Penury
and series of accidents will also follow.</p>

<p>In the sub-period of Guru in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, the
native will be intent on acquiring knowledge, robes and food.
He will render service to Gods and Brahmins and he will become
famous and rich.</p>

<p>During the Antar Dasha of &#346;ukr in S&#363;rya’s Dasha,
one will like to be away form his homeland, do futile jobs and
be argumentative in nature. He will develop diseases of neck
(throat), eyes and suffer from fever. He will be
independent.</p>

<p>In &#346;ani’s sup-period in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, one
will have troubles form men, enemies and thieves. He will be
discorded by friends. There will be declination in his wealth,
profession and service.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of Candr, in the sub-period of S&#363;rya, one
will be engaged in serving in bad countries (or places) and will
desire to be in the company of bad women. His wealth will
decrease and he will quarrel with his own relatives.</p>

<p>In the sub-period of Mangal in the Dasha of Candr, the
subject will be deprives of his sons and relatives. He will be
sick and his personal safety will be at risk. He will be of
cunning disposition. He will be displaced in this Bhukti.</p>

<p>During the sub-period of Budh in the Dasha of Candr, the
native will be wealthy with a fleet of cows, elephants and
horses; he will always be enthusiastic and he will be virtuous.
He will derive happiness through cows and elephants (i.e. he
will be comfortably placed because of his having such animals at
his command) and he will acquire sons etc.</p>

<p>In the sub-period of Guru in Candr Dasha one will be virtuous
(or one will be liberal in donating) and enjoy all luxuries. He
will be rich in knowledge and possess wealth, acquire fame and
live in foreign countries.</p>

<p>In the Antar Dasha of &#346;ukr, in the Dasha of Candr, one

<p>During &#346;ani’s Antar Dasha in Candr’s Dasha, one will get
money through kings, thieves and thefts. He will be deprived of

be fickleminded, subject to accidents in water and be
argumentative in nature.</p>

<p>During the sub-period of &#346;ukr in Guru’s Dasha, one will
be subjected to windy and phlegmatic complaints. He will be
troubled by deficiencies relating to digestive fire. He will
like very much to do virtuous deeds. He will be intent on
acquiring knowledge, robes etc.</p>

<p>In the Antar Dasha of &#346;ani in Guru’s Dasha, one will
acquire money through husbandry and cattle. He will be addicted
to women. He will have a ‘dilapidated’ body. He will be troubled
by servants, poison etc.</p>

<p>During S&#363;rya’s Antar Dasha in &#346;ukr’s Dasha, one
will have troubles in anus and eyes, growth of the spleen to
excess etc. He will invite the displeasure of the sovereign,
suffer through relatives and lose his money.</p>

<p>In Candr’s Antar Dasha in the Dasha of &#346;ukr, there will

will have wife and sons and be very rich. He will be virtuously
disposed, destroy his enemies, pursue Vedic Science (or will be
a follower of Nyaya) and become a preceptor himself.</p>

<p>Should two, three, or four Grahas be together in one
R&#257;&#347;i, the results mentioned earlier are not revealed.
In such case, only difficulties follow.</p>

<p>Should these not be in their own Bhavas, or in exaltation, in
such Dasha, one will have grief only. He will be deprived of his
courage and affluence and become poor and sick.</p>

<p>The Grahas in Konas will in their periods give happiness,
wife, sons and wealth. The ones posited in Bandhu Bhava give
friends, health, happiness and wealth.</p>

<p>The period of a Grah in Yuvati Bhava makes one hate women,
while that of Grah in Randhr Bhava will give death, or sickness.
The results of Dasha Bhukti should be predicted in such a
manner.</p>

<p>Lagn Dasha results will be similar to its lord. The Dasha
Bhukti of Rahu will be, like that of &#346;ani.</p>

<p>During Rahu Bhukti in the Dasha of S&#363;rya, or Candr, or
Mangal, or &#346;ani, death will happen. Similar is the
effecting Rahu Dasha, when the Antar Dasha is that of
S&#363;rya, or Candr, or Mangal, or &#346;ani. In other Dashas,
or Bhuktis, i.e.  contrary to the said order, there will be
mixed results by Rahu.</p>

<p>The Dasha of the lord of the Navamsh occupied by Yuvati’s
lord will bless the native with a wife.</p>

<p>The mutual periods of the lords of Ari and Randhr Bhava will
cause death. Of these two, whoever is stronger, will cause the
death.</p>

<p>The Dasha of the lord of Rahu’s Navamsh may cause death of
the native in a Bhukti whose lord is inimical to him.</p>

<p>In Lagn Dasha, in a Bhukti of an inimical Grah (with
references to Lagn), the end of the subject may occur. However,
a benefic in Lagn can prevent such an event.</p>

<p>Note the lords of Lagn and Candr R&#257;&#347;i and the
Grahas, that are inimical to these two Grahas. Should any
R&#257;&#347;i in the Ashtak Varg of such Grahas be without
benefic dots, death will occur in the Dasha Bhuktis of such
R&#257;&#347;i lords.</p>

<p>If Lagn’s lord is in fall, while a malefic is posited in Lagn
and &#346;ukr is in Randhr Bhava, one will be troubled by
sickness in such Dasha Bhuktis.</p>

<p>The longitudes of the lords of Ari, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava
should be added together. When &#346;ani comes in Gochara to the
R&#257;&#347;i thus revealed, death of the native’s brother will
happen.  Its Kon also should be similarly considered.</p>

<p>During the period, when Guru transits the 22<sup>nd</sup>
Dreshkan from Lagn, or Candr’s R&#257;&#347;i, or during the
period, when Guru is in Kon to such 22<sup>nd</sup> Dreshkan in
Gochara, the subject himself will die.</p>

<p>The Sphutas of Guru and Rahu at birth should be added. When
Guru in transit comes to the R&#257;&#347;i thus revealed, or,
when Guru is in Kon in transit to such R&#257;&#347;i, death of
the native will happen.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya in transit arrive in a R&#257;&#347;i (or
its Konas) represented by the Dwadashamsh R&#257;&#347;i of
Randhr’s lord, death of the native will take place. Similar
results can be predicted, when S&#363;rya in transit arrives in
the R&#257;&#347;i occupied by Randhr’s lord, or its Konas, or,
when S&#363;rya comes to Vyaya Bhava.</p>

<p>The longitude of S&#363;rya must be changed into minutes of
arc and multiplied by Rahu’s longitude converted into minutes.
The product should be divided by 21600 and the quotient etc.
should be added to the longitude of S&#363;rya at birth. Should
S&#363;rya in transit arrive such a R&#257;&#347;i, or its
Konas, death of the native will occur. This is Chanakya’s school
of thought.</p>

<p>When Candr transits the Bhava occupied by the eighth lord
counted from the natal Candr (or its Konas) death may occur.
Alternatively, add the longitudes of eighth lord and the natal
Candr. Should Candr in transit arrive at such a R&#257;&#347;i
revealed by the said addition, death may happen, or, if Candr in
transit arrives at such a Navamsh, the same event may occur.</p>

<p>Should Candr in transit arrive at natal Lagn, natal Candr,
such Amshas, Ari Bhava, or Randhr Bhava, death will occur.</p>

<p>Should Randhr Bhava from Lagn, or from Candr, or Lagn, or
Candr, or Lagn with a fallen Grah in it be void of Grahas, death
of the native will take place.</p>

<p>Grahas, though auspicious, if they are indicative of such
death inflicting Yogas, they will only yield adverse results in
their periods. Such Grahas cannot be pacified by Yagya’s,
donations, Homas and Japas.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 18<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Effects of Dashas
and Antar Dashas of Grahas”, in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of
Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=19>Ch. 19. Candr and Nabhash Yogas</a></h2>

<p>Should the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and both
2<sup>nd</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> from Candr be occupied by
Grahas excluding S&#363;rya, the three resulting Yogas are
known, respectively, as Sunapha Yog, Anapha Yog and Durudhura
Yog. Should the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and
6<sup>th</sup> from Candr (or from Lagn) be occupied by benefic,
free from a yuti with S&#363;rya, Adhi Yog results.</p>

<p>One born with Sunapha Yog will enjoy money earned by his own
exertion. He will be bestowed with wisdom, be dear to a king and
be a king himself. He will be rich in the knowledge of Shastras
and be a commentator there of; he will be virtuous and
famous.</p>

<p>One born in Anapha Yog will have political wisdom (Naya),
moral training (Vinaya), be steadfast, know many Shastras and be
with enormous wealth. He will be capable of attracting the fair
sex and be honoured.</p>

<p>One born with Durudhura Yog will enjoy luxuries, money and
wealth. An eloquent speaker, he will be fond of battles and he
himself will become an army chief. He will be in a state of
bewilderness. He will be a king and will sacrifice his
possessions. He will have cattle.</p>

<p>One born with Adhi Yog will become a Minister, commander, or
a king. He will possess wealth, will have courage and will have
a long lease of life. He will destroy his enemies.</p>

<p>Should the Adhi Yog causing Grahas be benefic in nature, the
results will mature effortlessly. Malefics yield such results
only after efforts. One born in Adhi Yog, which is caused by
malefic(s) will get only adverse results.</p>

<p>Candr’s position with reference to S&#363;rya, if placed in
Kendras etc., the effects will be bad, medium and fine,
respectively. In the case of Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhura
Yogas, if Candr is waning the effects will be meagre.</p>

<p>Sunapha, Anapha and Durudhura Yogas will not be put to
effect, if Candr, or Lagn’s Kendras are not occupied. In such
case, the Yog arising is called Kema Drum, which makes even a
king beg.</p>

<p>Vyaya Bhava, Dhan Bhava and both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava, if
occupied by Grahas, with reference to S&#363;rya, cause three
Yogas, respectively called Vasi, Vesi and Ubbayachari. For Vasi
and Vesi Yog, Candr is no consideration.</p>

<p>A person born in Vesi Yog will walk slowly, be soft-spoken,
have eyes revealing hopelessness, be dear to his men and have
balanced income and outflow. The Vasi Yog native will be sinful,
defective limbed, present himself sleepy, laborious, if malefics
cause the Yog. In the case of good Grahas, which should also be
strong, the subject is blessed with all kinds of comforts and
wealth. The native born with Ubbayachari Yog will indulge in too
much utterances, be wise, strong, be a leader among his men and
dear to the king. He will be ever enthusiastic, eloquent and
wise. These results follow, if this Yog is caused by
benefics.</p>

<p>Should Dhan Bhava, Vyaya Bhava, or both Bhavas with reference
to Lagn be occupied by Grahas other than the luminaries, the
resulting Yogas are named, as Susubh, Asubh and Karthari,
respectively.</p>

<p>One born in Susubh Yog will be wealthy, attached to women,
principled, ever active, fickleminded, luxurious, unreasonable,
or unintelligible and be head of some monetary transactions. An
Asubh Yog native will have a strong body, be leader of his
caste, very enthusiastic, be an able speaker and be helpful to
others. He will sacrifice, be dear to all and very famous. One
born in Karthari Yog will be disposed to height of angry,
grieved, will hate parents and will lack enthusiasm. He will be
intent on living in other countries and be subjected to risk by
poison, fire and weapons.  These results follow due to malefic
participants in the Yog.</p>

<p>Benefics in Ari, Yuvati and Randhr Bhava from Lagn, free from
Drishti, or yuti of a malefic, cause Lagnadhi Yog.  Malefics
should not be in Bandhu Bhava.</p>

<p>The person, who has his birth in Lagnadhi Yog will become a
minister, army chief, or a king. He will have many wives, be
humble, will enjoy a long lease of life, be virtuously disposed
and be free from any enemies.</p>

<p>Should there be Grahas in Tanu, Yuvati, Karm and Bandhu Bhava
and none in Vyaya Bhava and Randhr Bhava, while Dharm Bhava has
an occupant in it, the resulting Yog is called Parvath Yog. A
Parvath Yog native will rule the earth, be virtuous and modest.
He will create villages, towns and cities. He will have his fame
last till the Yuga ends.</p>

<p>If the Grahas are with strength and are placed severally, one
of them in another’s R&#257;&#347;i and one at least be posited
in Lagn, Dhwaj Yog is produced.</p>

<p>A Dhwaj Yog native will acquire wide fame, courage and
wisdom. He will be liked in royal circles and be rich. He will
be fickleminded.</p>

<p>If two strong Grahas are in two different Bhavas, with one,
or two Bhavas in between them, while others are in other Bhavas,
Kundala Yog results.</p>

<p>One born in Kundala Yog will live on other’s money, be easily
irritated at the slightest pretext and will remain satisfied
with little; he will be versed in literature and arts, be short
lived and will have limited number of children.</p>

<p>All the Grahas (i.e. from S&#363;rya to &#346;ani) disposed
in one Bhava cause Gola Yog; in two R&#257;&#347;is: Yuga Yog;
in three R&#257;&#347;is: Sula Yog; in four R&#257;&#347;is
Kedara Yog; in five R&#257;&#347;is: Pasha Yog; in six
R&#257;&#347;is: Dama Yog; and in seven R&#257;&#347;is Veena
Yog, causing wide fame.</p>

<p>One born in Veena Yog will be very learned and have various
kinds of wealth, luxuries etc. at his disposal. He will be chief
among his own men, wise and expert. He will love right things
and be very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>A Dama Yog native will be happy, kind and devoted to public
welfare (or their work) and a noted scholar. He will be wise and
rich and exhibit valour in wars.</p>

<p>One born in Pasha Yog will be burdened with many expenses, be
an expert and dear to all. He will be a great intellectual,
enthusiastic and be liked in royal circles. He will engage in
activities relating to his house.</p>

<p>The native of Kedara Yog will help his relatives, earn money
through agriculture, be dutiful, sluggish and honoured.</p>

<p>The native with Sula Yog will be intelligent and will have
many means of livelihood. He will be very sick, earn by
purchases and sales, will have two wives, but no child.</p>

<p>One born with Yuga Yog will be disabled, harsh in speech and
shameless. He will have many debts, be short lives and will have
limited relatives.</p>

<p>One born with Gola Yog will have a short lease of life, be
not wealthy, be defective in some limb and a killer of his own
children. He will have no relations, sons and wife. He will be
always on the move and be hungry and banished. The results
mentioned do not apply to Karm, Labh, Tanu and Dharm Bhavas.</p>

<p>Should all the Grahas (from S&#363;rya to &#346;ani) be Kendr
to Lagn, Mangala Yog is produced. Should they be (specifically)
confined to Karm Bhava, Madhya Yog is produced. If the Grahas
are posited in Sahaj, Ari, Dharm and Vyaya Bhava (disposed in
any manner in these four Bhavas), a Yog called Kleeba is
produced. These three kinds of Yogas are known, as Kendr Yogas
and belong to Yavanas (Greek astrologers).</p>

<p>A Mangala Yog native will be doing auspicious acts for ever.
He will be an able orator. He will have issues, be intelligent
and be long lived.</p>

<p>A Madhya Yog native will live in other countries, be troubled
by relatives and be timid in nature. He won’t have lasting
wealth, will have few issues and will die through bad ways.</p>

<p>Kleeba Yog native will be grieved, will live in other
countries, be in the company of mean women and fond of disputes.
He will have no long life and his death will be in a distant
country.</p>

<p>Should all the Grahas (from S&#363;rya to &#346;ani) be in
movable R&#257;&#347;is (i.e. Mesh and its Kendras), the
resulting Yog is Rajju. In fixed R&#257;&#347;is (i.e. Vrishabh
and its Kendras), these produce Musala Yog. Lastly, in Ubahya
R&#257;&#347;is (common, or dual R&#257;&#347;is, i.e. Mithun
and its Kendras), Nala Yog is produced by occupation of all the
seven Grahas.</p>

<p>One born with Rajju Yog will not be industrious. He will be
poor and will go with bad people. He has a medium span of
life.</p>

<p>One born in Musala Yog will be energetic blessed with wife,
sons and wealth. He will enjoy all kinds of wealth, be wise and
dear to his own men.</p>

<p>The person, who has Nala Yog will be intelligent. He will be
disabled and be with few issues. He will be intent upon doing
acts beneficial to others; he will be rich and will have a
medium span of life.</p>

<p>If all the benefics be in Kendr Bhavas, Mala Yog is formed.
In a like position malefics cause Sarpa Yog.</p>

<p>The native, who has Mala Yog will be learned and wealthy.
Should these benefics be confined to Karm and Tanu Bhava only,
his race does not descend.</p>

<p>One born in Sarpa Yog will talk too much and will leave his
paternal place. He will be a source of trouble to others and
derive pleasure thereby. He will be short lived.</p>

<p>When all the Grahas occupy the first six R&#257;&#347;is,
Shatpad Yog is produced. The person born with this Yog will
command leadership over money and gather the essence (of
Shastras).</p>

<p>If these Grahas are posited in Tanu, Putr and Bandhu Bhava,
Varah Yog follows. Such a native will command land, wealth,
happiness and wisdom.</p>

<p>All the Grahas in Dhan, Sahaj and Bandhu Bhava cause Kantaka
Yog. One born in such Yog will be wealthy and learned, but short
lived. He will have no issue.</p>

<p>Hala Yog is produced, when Lagn and Vyaya Bhava hold all the
Grahas. Should they be in Lagn, Putr and Dharm Bhava, Shringatak
Yog is formed and, when these are in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava,
Sakata Yog is formed. Vihaga Yog is produced, when such Grahas
are all in Bandhu and Karm Bhava.</p>

<p>A Hala Yog native will be disposed to angry, be very poor,
disabled and short lived. He will be a farmer. A Shringatak Yog
native will have wind, as a predominant temperament and be
angry. He will be a great man, but poor.</p>

<p>One born in Sakata Yog will be moving, like a cart. He will
be bereaved by death of his son and wife. He will be of wicked
mentality, idle and have defective sight.</p>

<p>One born in Vihaga Yog will be happy and engaged in amassing
wealth in several ways. His valour will be unsurpassed. He will
have many places to reside and he will be loved, when in others’
places.</p>

<p>When all the Grahas occupy Dharm, Labh, Tanu and Bandhu
Bhava, Sankh Yog is produced. Should they occupy the six odd
Bhavas, (i.e. Mesh, Mithun, Simh etc.) Chakr Yog is formed. So
have the sages mentioned. Should all the Grahas be ranged from
Dhan Bhava in six R&#257;&#347;is, intervened by Bhavas without
Grahas, Samudra Yog is formed.  (That is Grahas should be in
Dhan, Bandhu, Ari, Randhr, Karm and Vyaya Bhava with the other
Bhavas having no Grahas; this will cause Samudra Yog). When
these Grahas in such condition have two blank Bhavas, Indra Yog
is formed.</p>

<p>The effects of Sankha Yog are: the native will be a
repository of virtues brave and versed. The one, who has Chakr
Yog will be a repository of good qualities, be a king and will
attain the throne of a large kingdom. One born in Samudra Yog
will be blind right from birth will be dear to all, miser, lord
of money and will have issues. One born in Indra Yog (or
Mahendra Yog, as called in this Sloka) will be famous and will
have many titles. He will be wealthy and also a superior
man.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 19<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Candr and Nabhash
Yogas” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=20>Ch. 20. Raj Yogas</a></h2>

<p>Should Candr, or Lagn be in Vargothama Navamsh and receives a
Drishti from four, or more Grahas, the person born will be a
king.</p>

<p>If &#346;ukr is placed in Ashvini Nakshatr identical with
Lagn and receives a Drishti from all the other Grahas, one will
become a king conquering the entire band of his enemies.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be placed in Dhan Bhava, not being yuti with
a debilitated, or inimical Grah and join Lagn’s lord with
strength, the native rules over the earth.</p>

<p>Should three, or more Grahas be in own, or exaltation Bhavas,
without being in fall in Navamsh, one will become a king, who
will win the band of his enemies.</p>

<p>If three, or more Grahas be in their own, or exaltation
Bhavas, avoiding debilitation Navamshas and at the same time
being one of them in Lagn, the person becomes a king.</p>

<p>Should Candr and Mangal be in Lagn, Dharm, or Karm Bhava,
while S&#363;rya and Guru are strong, the native will become a
king.</p>

<p>Should Guru give a Drishti to Budh, the native will become a
king whose orders will faithfully be obeyed by other kings.</p>

<p>Should Candr, in the case of a night birth, occupy a friendly
Navamsh and receives a Drishti from &#346;ukr, one will become a
king; Other Grahas giving a Drishti to such Candr will not make
him a king.</p>

<p>Should Candr, in the case of a day birth, be in her own
Navamsh, or in exaltation Navamsh, or in a friendly Navamsh, or
receive a Drishti from Guru, the person will become a king.</p>

<p>If Simh rises, at sunrise, avoiding a Navamsh of &#346;ukr,
when Budh is in Kanya, even a mean person will become a
king.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be in Meen in R&#257;&#347;i and Navamsh,
while Meen ascends in R&#257;&#347;i and Navamsh, one will
become a king. Mangal and &#346;ani in Lagn, or Putr, or Karm
Bhava will give similar results.</p>

<p>Full Candr in Dharm Bhava causes the birth of a king.</p>

<p>Pushkala Yog is formed, if the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i
is in a friendly Kendr along with Lagn’s lord and, if that lord
gives a Drishti to Lagn. The dispositor of Candr should be
strong in this Yog.</p>

<p>A Pushkala Yog native will, as a rule, lord over the earth.
Should he be of royal scion, he will wear the regal crown and
adore a regal umbrella.</p>

<p>Should the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i be in a Kendr with
strength, the native will have an empire. If the said lord is in
a Drishti to, or yuti with a friendly Grah, even a low born
person will become a king.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord be in his exaltation R&#257;&#347;i,
giving a Drishti to Candr, one will become a king to command a
wide fleet of elephants, horses and such other forces, destroy
his enemies in total and have at his disposal a great
paraphernalia.</p>

<p>Should Candr, full of her digits, be in a Kendr, other than
Lagn, (i.e. Bandhu, Yuvati, or Karm Bhava) and receives a
Drishti from Guru and &#346;ukr, the native lords over the
earth.</p>

<p>If the lord of Lagn is exalted, at the same time not being in
inimical Bhava, or debilitation Amsh and, when lonely placed in
a Kendr, this will make one a king of kings.</p>

<p>Should Mangal be in Lagn, identical with Mesh, Simh, or Dhanu
and in a Drishti to a friendly Grah, one will become a king, who
with the strength of his own hands destroys the enemies.</p>

<p>Should Mangal be in Karm Bhava in Nakshatr Ashvini, Anuradha,
or Dhanishtha, or, if S&#363;rya is in Lagn other than Tula, the
native will become a king.</p>

<p>Counted from Mangal, if Guru is in the fifth, Candr in the
third and S&#363;rya in the ninth R&#257;&#347;i, the person
will become a king and equal himself to Kubera (the controller
of Nava Nidhis for Gods).</p>

<p>Even, if one Grah is in exaltation and receives a Drishti
from a friend, a king is born. If the said Grah is placed in
Lagn, along with a friend, one becomes a king with grains and of
wealth.</p>

<p>When even one Grah is exalted, while Candr is in her own
Bhava in Lagn, with strength, one born in a royal family will
become a king and will be respected by the public.</p>

<p>Benefics in Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh Bhava, while malefics
are relegated to Lagn and the Zenith, the native will surely
become a king of the earth and be saluted (by all). He will be
also versed in politics.</p>

<p>A king equal to Devendra is born, if &#346;ukr with strength
occupies Labh, or Vyaya Bhava, while Mangal is cleanly posited
in Lagn (i.e. well posited) identical with Makar and &#346;ani
is in Dharm, or Vyaya Bhava. (The position of &#346;ukr, as
above can also be interpreted independent of
Mangal/&#346;ani)</p>

<p>Should Candr and S&#363;rya be in Yuvati Bhava, a
fickleminded king is born.</p>

<p>If malefics are relegated to Labh, Sahaj and Ari Bhava, while
the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i receives a Drishti from a
benefic, one will be a king, revered by all and will be a
virtuous man.</p>

<p>In the case of a male, Bhagya Yog is formed in day birth, if
all Grahas are in odd R&#257;&#347;is (i.e. Mesh, Mithun etc.)
and Candr is waxing. Similarly for females born in night time
(i.e. after the sunset and before the sunrise). One born in
Bhagya Yog will be a scholar, intent on doing auspicious things,
know celestial music and possess elephants and wealth.</p>

<p>Bhagya Yog will be more effective, if there is additionally a
benefic in Lagn.</p>

<p>Base men with Raj Yogas will become kings.  And those born in
royal scion will rule the earth.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 20<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitles “Raj Yogas” in
Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=21>Ch. 21. Results of Grahas in the Several Bhavas</a></h2>

<p>If &#346;ukr is placed in Vyaya Bhava, it makes a person go
after women, otherwise righteous, but undutiful.</p>

<p>If Vyaya Bhava is the own Bhava, or exaltation Bhava of
&#346;ukr one will be wealthy and marry a famous lady.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Lagn, the native will be very sick in
his boyhood, be dirty and a wanderer. He will also be wicked in
nature. He will not be loyal to the fair sex and he will be
windy in temperament; he will be disabled.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in its own Bhava or, if &#346;ani is exalted,
in Lagn, the person will be principal in his clan, wise, wealthy
and be a king.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani occupies Dhan Bhava, the native will not have
any money left by his father. He will have self respect,
courage, wealth and be learned.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is placed in Sahaj Bhava, one will be brave,
unkind, witty and disrespected.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Bandhu Bhava, one will be troubled by his
own relatives, will not have many sons and will be unhappy.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is posited in Putr Bhava, the native will be
dull, will have limited number of sons and will suffer from eye
diseases. He will be a wanderer.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Ari Bhava, the native will be helpful, be
free from any enemies and diseases and he will be very
famous.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Yuvati Bhava, one will be mean,
fickleminded, grieved and one will be fond of his wife though
she will be wicked.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Randhr Bhava, one will be wealthy, sick,
will not have many sons, will be weak sighted and
fickleminded.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is placed in Dharm Bhava, one will hold the flag
of Dharma aloft, be a great expert, be greatly wise and just and
one will have sons.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be posited in Karm Bhava, one will have good
mental disposition, will be wealthy, chief of his caste and
happy.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is placed in Labh Bhava, the native will be of
lordly disposition and famous; he will be a scientist and an
expert in the use of weapons (and in surgery).</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Vyaya Bhava, the native will blame others,
be burdened with heavy expenditure and be unhappy.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in a Bhava, along with its lord, the
benefic and malefic results will be dependent on both.</p>

<p>A Grah in fall, or inimically placed will adversely affect
the Bhava in question. Whatever has been said in regard to the
12 Bhavas with reference to Lagn equally applies, when counted
from Candr.</p>

<p>The results of various Bhavas can be predicted from Candr and
from Lagn. Such results for every R&#257;&#347;i can be
predicted accurately. The results of Bhavas will be wither, if
three, or more Grahas are posited in one Bhava.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 21<sup>st</sup> Ch. entitled “Results of Grahas
in the Several Bhavas” in Horashara, of Prithuyasas, son of
Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=22>Ch. 22. {Implications of Karm Bhava}</a></h2>

<p>One’s obtainment of wealth (i.e. one’s livelihood) is the
product of his own inner nature. Such wealth is acquired through
the Grahas posited in Karm Bhava counted from Lagn, Candr and
S&#363;rya, or the respective Navamshas.</p>

<p>Money comes through father, mother, brother, relative, elder
(preceptor), wife and low class men according to the Grah
concerned be S&#363;rya etc., as indicated by the position in
Karm Bhava from Lagn, or from Candr.</p>

<p>If Karm Bhava is without a Grah, then the strongest among
Candr, or S&#363;rya should be considered. The lord of the
R&#257;&#347;i, in which Karm’s lord is posited may also be
considered. (That is the said Navamshas will denote the kind of
livelihood).</p>

<p>Should the lord of such Amsh be S&#363;rya, the person earns
through fruits, trees, medicines, metals, sculpture, betting,
falsehood, cheating and royal sources.</p>

<p>Candr’s Amsh in such case indicates:  pearls, carriers run in
water, husbandry, water, clothes etc., cows, buffaloes, sugar,
female’s company, chanting Mantras, hymns and the like and
worship of Gods.</p>

<p>Such Amsh of Mangal denotes:  teaching, Mantras, bravery,
weapons (or surgery etc.), fire, medicines, selling in marker
and through Kshatriyas (i.e. persons of royal scion).</p>

<p>In such Amsh of Budh, the livelihood is through: writings,
drawings, literature, mathematics, bets, dancing, donations
(i.e. the person will receive donations in marriages, Shraddas
etc.), education and loving speech.</p>

<p>Should such Amsh be of Guru, the means of livelihood will be
from: education, worship of Gods (i.e. temple priesthood,
Mantras, Japas, exposition of Mantras, knowledge of the three
periods (i.e. Jyotish), Sakunas and royal favours.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be the lord of such Amsh, the livelihood
will be through: cows, buffaloes, horses, elephants etc., the
company of women, medicines, beautification, singing etc. and
one will be happy through these.</p>

<p>Should the said Amsh be of &#346;ani, the source of living
will be: fruits, leaves, carrying loads, labour, base men,
servants, sales of grain and inferior grains (Khubhanya) (?)
labour carrying loads, base deeds, sesame, salt, grains,
vegetables, grass, firewood, water etc.</p>

<p>Should the Grah, owning the Amsh, be very strong, one will
earn money effortlessly and, if the Grah owning the Amsh is in
deep fall, the results mentioned will manifest in little
proportion.</p>

<p>The Jyotishi should advise (the means of livelihood) in the
direction of the country indicated (by the study of the
Kundali), or the country suitable to Karm Bhava from Lagn.</p>

<p>The sages say, that, if the said Bhavas receive Drishti from
their own lords, then, the native will earn in his own country
and, if the said Bhavas receive a Drishti from, or are yuti with
other Grahas, the livelihood will be in other countries.</p>

<p>If the lord of the said Amsh is posited in a movable
R&#257;&#347;i, or Amsh, the native earns even, when in other
countries/places and be happy; if the lord of the said lord of
the Amsh is posited in a fixed R&#257;&#347;i, or Amsh, the
earnings will be only in his native country and, if the lord of
the Amsh is placed in a dual R&#257;&#347;i, or Amsh, the
earnings will be anywhere.</p>

<p>Should the lord of the said Amsh be in retrograde motion
money will be acquired in many ways. And one’s earning will be
proportionate to one’s own luck. The results have already been
enumerated in full.</p>

<p>Even one strong benefic in Karm Bhava from Candr, not
receiving a Drishti from, or not yuti with malefics, is enough
to make a person enjoy fame for him and his family till the end
of the Yuga. The counting applies similarly to Lagn also.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 22<sup>nd</sup> Ch., {Implications of Karm
Bhava} in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=23>Ch. 23. Conjunctions of Two, or More Grahas and their
Effects</a></h2>

<p>The combination of two, or more Grahas always affect the
Bhava concerned. The effects of such combinations may also yield
a poisonous mixture, as honey and ghee together yield.</p>

<p>The brief results of such combinations of Grahas are
explained infra. The results arising out of transits of Grahas
should be correlated by the Jyotishi before issuing
predictions.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya and Budh are together in Bandhu Bhava, or in
Randhr Bhava from Lagn, the person born will be equal to a king
in qualities and be wealthy.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya and Budha together in a Bhava, other then the
4<sup>th</sup>, or 8<sup>th</sup>, will make one virtuous.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya and Candr are together in Dharm Bhava, the
native will be wealthy.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya and Candr are together in Karm Bhava, he will
attain fame.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya and Candr are in the 12<sup>th</sup>, the
native will be ousted from his caste. In such a case, he will
also be blind.</p>

<p>This combination in other Bhavas does not give wealth.</p>

<p>Should a person of royal family have Candr and &#346;ani in
Labh, Ari, Putr, or Karm Bhava, in his Janm Kundali, he will
ascend the royal throne. There is no doubt in it.</p>

<p>The combination of S&#363;rya and Mangal in Karm, Labh, Tanu,
or Randhr Bhava, causes one’s birth in a great family and
bestows great strength, whereas this conjunction in other Bhavas
gives no wealth.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya and Guru are together in Lagn, Dharm, Karm, or
Labh Bhava, the native has strong command and fame and will be
inaccessible (i.e. he will be too big a person to be reached by
all).</p>

<p>The conjunction of S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr occurring in
Karm, Randhr, or Putr Bhava makes a person equal to a king,
famous and mighty.</p>

<p>The conjunction of S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr occurring in
places, other then Karm, Randhr, or Putr Bhava will give only
penury and unhappiness.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and &#346;ani dwell in Dharm, Dhan, or Ari
Bhava together, they give widespread fame and happiness.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya and &#346;ani together in other Bhavas, then 2, 9,
or 6 leads to no wealth.</p>

<p>Should Mangal and Candr be together in Karm, Dharm, Putr, or
Labh Bhava, one will become wealthy and be equal to a king.</p>

<p>In other Bhavas, one is deprived of his relatives and
happiness as well.</p>

<p>The native will be learned in poetry and arts and be wealthy,
if he has Budh and Candr together in Sahaj, Vyaya, Ari, or
Randhr Bhava in his Janm Kundali.</p>

<p>If in other Bhavas, one will be fearless and indigent.</p>

<p>Should Guru and Candr be not in Dhan, or Ari Bhava, or
depressed, the native with a combination of these two, will be
wealthy. He will have wife and sons and be well-mannered.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr and Candr be together in Karm Bhava, one
will be an expert trader, will enjoy good robes and life and
will lord over money.</p>

<p>If &#346;ukr and Candr be in Vyaya Bhava, he will obtain
money from foreign countries.</p>

<p>If Mangal and &#346;ani be together in Dharm, Putr, Bandhu,
Karm, or Dhan Bhava, one will have sons, relatives, virtue and
wealth.</p>

<p>One is unlucky and dirty, if one has Mangal and &#346;ani
together in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>,
7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup>, or
12<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>Candr and &#346;ani together give an emaciated body. Such
native will be bent upon doing base deeds, will dislike his
mother and will be a fool.</p>

<p>Candra and &#346;ani together in Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh
Bhava bestow all kinds of wealth.</p>

<p>Should Mangal and Budh be in one Bhava, the native has no
steady mind. He will be satisfied with little. He will be dirty
and like to eat other’s food.</p>

<p>If Mangal and Budh be together in a Kendr, the native will
get wealth and be happy.</p>

<p>If Mangal and Guru be in one Bhava, the native will be long
lived, will obtain sons, will be well-behaved.</p>

<p>Should Mangal and Guru, be together in a Dusthan Bhava, i.e.
Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, the person will be addicted to
vices, be sick and will have not much wealth.</p>

<p>If Mangal and &#346;ukr are disposed in one Bhava, the native
will be fickleminded, will be at his wife’s disposal and will
indulge in wicked acts.</p>

<p>Should Mangal and &#346;ukr be together in Lagn, Bandhu, or
Karm Bhava, one will be chief of his caste, or head of the
village.</p>

<p>Mangal and &#346;ani in one Bhava give windy troubles (i.e.
rheumatism etc.) and bilious complaints.</p>

<p>Should Mangal ans &#346;ani be together in Sahaj, Ari, Karm,
or Labh Bhava, the native will be equal to a king, liked by all
and famous.</p>

<p>If Budh and Guru are in one Bhava, one will be deaf, learned
and will have eye diseases.</p>

<p>If Budh and Guru are together in Vyaya, Randhr, or Ari Bhava,
one will be lucky, famous and virtuously disposed.</p>

<p>Should Budh and &#346;ukr be in one Bhava, the native will be
maimed (or spiritless); his welfare (or prosperity) will be
checkered. He will have a mean wife and mean sons and yet he
will be affectionate to them.</p>

<p>Should Buddha and &#346;ukr be conjunct in Dharm, Putr, or
Tanu Bhava, he will earn titles and immense money.</p>

<p>Should Budh and &#346;ani be in Karm, Tanu, or Dharm Bhava,
one will have wealth, wife and sons and friends.</p>

<p>Budh and &#346;ani together in other Bhavas, then Karm, Tanu,
or Dharm Bhava, will yield inauspicious results.</p>

<p>If Guru and &#346;ukr join in Tanu, Putr, Dharm, or Randhr
Bhava, the native will enjoy wife, wealth and sons.</p>

<p>Should Guru and &#346;ukr be conjunct in one Bhava, other
than Tanu, Putr, Dharm, or Randhr, one will be troubled by
diseases and be sorrowful.</p>

<p>If Guru and &#346;ani are posited in Bhavas, other then
Sahaj, Ari, Karm and Labh Bhava, the native will have no
self-respect and money.</p>

<p>Should Guru and &#346;ani be together in Sahaj, Ari, Karm, or
Labh Bhava, one will be famous and be worshipped by the
king.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr and &#346;ani be in Lagn, Putr, Dharm,
Bandhu, or Karm Bhava, one will be commanded by his wife, be a
chief in royal service and wealthy.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr and &#346;ani be together in a Bhava, other
then Lagn, Putr, Dharm, Bandhu, or Karm Bhava, the native will
be deprived one of his strength and money.</p>

<p>With the yuti of S&#363;rya, Candr and Mangal, the native
will be most sinfully disposed. His livelihood will not have
much progress. He will be without relative, wife and children.
He will be disabled. He will be blamed by the public and be a
miser.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya, Mangal and Budh be in one Bhava, the
native will be against righteous deeds. He will live in distant
countries, be a miser and be unkind. The wealth acquired by him
will vanish and he will be sorrowful.</p>

<p>The combination of S&#363;rya, Candr, Budh and Guru in one
Bhava will make a person intelligent, dear to a king, penniless
at the end and thus dependent on others even for morsel of food.
The native will hurt others’ feelings.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya, Guru and &#346;ukr ar in one R&#257;&#347;i,
the person will be intent upon giving donations, praised by the
public and be a king. He will be cheated by women and in
gambling and thus be devoid of his wealth. He will have trouble
from enemies. He will suffer from grief.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani be in one Bhava,
the native will be devoid of religious codes, be a big cheat and
be miserable. He will not have any income. he will be sick. But,
in his old age, he will possess some money.</p>

<p>If Candr, Mangal and Budh be in one Bhava, the native will
become famous, be worshipped by the public, learned, eloquent in
speech, kind and will be penniless in the middle of his
life.</p>

<p>If Candr, Budh and Guru are posited in one Bhava, the native
will have a widely exalted status. He will be very learned,
rich, valorous and a king.</p>

<p>The native will undoubtedly become a king, if Candr, Guru and
&#346;ukr are placed in one Bhava. He will have elephants,
horses, conveyances, serving force, treasury etc. at his
command.</p>

<p>Should Candr, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani be in one Bhava, the
native will have self-respect, be rich and kind. He will have
luxuries at his disposal. His position in life will be neither
great nor significant. He will have sons and cattle and be
respected by his relatives.</p>

<p>If Candr, &#346;ani and S&#363;rya join in one
R&#257;&#347;i, one will not acquire much riches. He will be
accosted by diseases and be grieved. He will go begging and be
disabled. His means of livelihood will be: service and
dance.</p>

<p>Should Mangal, Budh and &#346;ukr join in a single
R&#257;&#347;i, one will be sick right from the childhood, to a
small extent. He will be in a position to remain jocularly
disposed, be a prince and widely famed.</p>

<p>Should Mangal, Guru and &#346;ukr be in one Bhava, the native
will have conveyances and attendants at his disposal.  He will
attain great fame and wealth. He will possess issues and lands
and enjoy greatly.</p>

<p>Should Mangal, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani be in one Bhava, it is
ominous for the mother of the subject. He will wander in foreign
countries and be addicted to other ladies. He will be base and
be insulted bu royal circles.</p>

<p>Should Mangal, &#346;ani and S&#363;rya be in conjunction,
the native will be a sinner. He will deceive others’ wives. He
will have a short span of life. His end will occur in a foreign
country through poison, fire, or jail.</p>

<p>If Mangal, S&#363;rya and Budh are placed in one Bhava, one
will ever be roaming. From time to time, he will gather some
grains and cook them (i.e. he will have to make efforts for
every square meal on a day-to-day basis).</p>

<p>The conjunction of Budh, Guru and &#346;ukr will make the
native a king. His possessions will be plentiful. He will be
modest. His fame will be spread in the (whole) region.</p>

<p>Should Budh, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani be in one Bhava, the
native will be ruler of men, wealthy, steady in mind, famous,
long lived, acceptable to all and learned.</p>

<p>Should Budh, &#346;ani and S&#363;rya be together, one will
have a very bloody and bilious physique, will hate his own men,
be meanly disposed, will live in foreign countries, will have
more veins and an emaciated body.</p>

<p>Should Budh, S&#363;rya and &#346;ukr be in one Bhava, the
native will enjoy luxuries, wealth and the kind and be among his
parents and relatives. He will have respect and valour.</p>

<p>If the Grahas Budh, &#346;ani and Mangal be together in one
Bhava, the native will be a prostitute’s husband, be intent on
living in distant countries, be inimical to his men, aggrieved,
short lived and loses his cattle and wife.</p>

<p>If Guru, &#346;ukr and &#346;ani join in one Bhava, the
native will be a principal member of his caste men and be happy
with his family. He will have limited gains and luxuries. He
will be famous and be liked by all.</p>

<p>Should Guru, Mangal and S&#363;rya be in conjunction, one
will be wealthy, worshipped by the people, learned and be free
from sickness and enemies. He will have every kind of
happiness.</p>

<p>Should Guru, Mangal and &#346;ani be in conjunction, the
native will be a town’s head and be strong. He will put up with
difficulties. He will be wealthy, jealously disposed, respected
and valorous.</p>

<p>Should Guru, &#346;ani and Candr be together, one will be
after women. He will have issues and be happy. He will speak
sweetly and be friendly to the people. He will respect his
parents, preceptors and Gods.</p>

<p>The native, who has three, or more Grahas either in Lagn, or
in Karm, or in Dharm Bhava, will engage himself in multifarious
activities, will have numerous good qualities, will be extremely
intelligent and will enjoy, like a lord of wealth.</p>

<p>Should Candr, Guru and Mangal be in one Bhava, they give
vigour and wealth. This is not so in the case of one of them
being in depression, or their being in Ari, Yuvati, or Randhr
Bhava.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani, Candr, Mangal and &#346;ukr join in Dharm,
Karm, or Tanu Bhava, one will not have any bonds of family and
relatives, will live in foreign places and be happy.</p>

<p>If benefics only join in a Bhava, the effects produced will
be very superior. Inauspicious results will follow, if malefics
join together. Combinations of Grahas, if they are mixed in
nature, then the effects will be equally mixed.</p>

<p>If four, or more Grahas join in a Bhava, only mixed effects
will follow. The results will manifest in the major and
sub-periods, depending on the good and bad disposition of the
Grahas.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 23<sup>rd</sup> Ch. entitled “Conjunctions of
Two, or More Grahas and their Effects” in Horashara of
Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=24>Ch. 24. Adverse Combinations for a Janm Kundali</a></h2>

<p>Should S&#363;rya, Candr and Mangal join in Tanu, Bandhu,
Yuvati, Karm, Dharm, or Vyaya Bhava, being devoid of strength,
the notorious Jal Yog is produced.</p>

<p>The native, who has Jal Yog will be dunce, unimportant and
devoid of any wisdom and wealth. He will have no fixity of mind.
He will be stubborn (in the sense, that he will not accept any
good thinking) and he will depend on others for food. He will be
subject to mental worries.</p>

<p>Kema Drum Yog (of another kind) is produced, when Dharm’s
lord is pushed to Vyaya Bhava, while Vyaya’s lord is in Dhan
Bhava without strength. Simultaneously, Sahaj Bhava shall have
placement of malefics.</p>

<p>One born with the Kema Drum Yog (mentioned in the above
Sloka) will be after other housewives, will always look up to
other for his food, will indulge in bad deeds and will contract
several debts.</p>

<p>Should Yuvati and Randhr Bhava be occupied by malefic Grahas,
while Lagn’s lord is in fall in R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh, one
born in Gulik Kala will destroy his family.</p>

<p>If all the Grahas are in fall in R&#257;&#347;i and Navamsh,
or, if they are exalted in Bhavas not happening to be Dharm, or
Karm Bhava, the native will only get his food by begging.</p>

<p>When Lagn’s lord is in Vyaya Bhava, a malefic is placed in
Karm Bhava and Candr is with Mangal, Abhi Yog is formed, which
makes one wander in distant places and suffer from penury.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and Candr be in Dharm, Tanu, or Putr Bhava,
while Guru is in Sahaj Bhava, or in a Kendr, one born thus will
become mad. In such a Yog, essentially, the Kala Hora at birth
shall be that of &#346;ani, or Mangal.</p>

<p>Should Candr and Budh join in a Kendr, without Drishti from,
or yuti with another Grah, Paishacha Yog is produced.  Such a
person will be mad.</p>

<p>If &#346;ukr and Candr are in a Kendr, while malefics are in
either Randhr, or Putr Bhava, Maha Gada Yog is produced.  The
result is insanity.</p>

<p>If Lagn is occupied by Mangal and &#346;ani, while its lord
is in Dhan, or Randhr Bhava along with Candr and Budh and
&#346;ukr are in a Kendr, even a person born in a superior caste
becomes a base man (i.e. he will not shine in life).</p>

<p>Should Mangal and &#346;ani be in a Kendr, Rahu in Lagn,
while benefics are in Vyaya, or Ari Bhava, Chandal Yog is
formed. This Yog will make one shun the duties prescribed for
the family he succeeds.</p>

<p>If Budh, &#346;ukr and Candr are relegated to Kendras, while
Rahu is rising, again Chandal Yog is produced. The person, who
has such Yog will take to mean acts.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is caused to one born in Parivesha Kala, who has
simultaneously &#346;ani and Mangal in Ari, or Randhr Bhava with
Guru not occupying Lagn, Putr, or Dharm Bhava.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani and Mangal be in Lagn, while Lagn’s lord is
in Dhan, Randhr, or Dharm Bhava, with benefics not being in
Kendras, one will suffer from diseases throughout his life.</p>

<p>Should Candr, &#346;ani and &#346;ukr be in Kendras, while
S&#363;rya and Mangal are in Vyaya and Randhr Bhava, another
kind of Kema Drum Yog is produced. Such native will confine to
his birth place only (for his livelihood).</p>

<p>If malefics are in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, one is ousted
from his caste. Same is the result, when these Grahas are in
Karm and Dhan Bhava, while auspicious R&#257;&#347;is are not
occupied by benefics.</p>

<p>Should Dharm’s lord be posited in Vyaya Bhava, while the lord
of Candr R&#257;&#347;i and Lagn’s lord are with malefics and
combust in S&#363;rya, the person will damage the fame of his
dynasty and will lose his wife and sons.</p>

<p>When Kendras are occupied by malefics and benefics and Candr
receives a Drishti from Lagn’s lord, or alternatively, is placed
in &#346;ani’s Amsh, there is formation of Kulapamsana Yog.</p>

<p>The native, who has Kulapamsana Yog will be deserted by his
family members, will face acute penury, live in foreign
countries, lose his wife and sons and suffer blemishes
galore.</p>

<p>If Dharm’s lord is in Dhan, or in Putr Bhava along with
S&#363;rya, not receiving a Drishti from benefics, while Sahaj
and Ari Bhava are occupied by malefics, one will take to mean
professions, or acts.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in a Bhava of &#346;ani, while &#346;ani is
in a Kendr and Guru is in Vyaya Bhava, the person resorts to
begging, as profession.</p>

<p>If there are malefic Grahas in the 8<sup>th</sup>, the
6<sup>th</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava counted from the
R&#257;&#347;i occupied by Lagn’s lord, one will leave his
native place.</p>

<p>If there are malefic Grahas in the 8<sup>th</sup>, the
6<sup>th</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> Bhava counted from the
R&#257;&#347;i occupied by the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i,
while Dharm Bhava is not occupied by its own lord, one will
leave his native place by selling away his possessions and
because of blemishes of his own.</p>

<p>Should Budh, Guru (Candr) and &#346;ukr be in their inimical
Bhavas, or in fall in R&#257;&#347;i/Amsh, while &#346;ani is in
Lagn, one will suffer on account of blemishes of the family
(i.e. his ancestors) and be deprived of wife and sons. The same
results can be indicated by Randhr Bhava also.</p>

<p>S&#363;rya singly in deep fall can nullify the good effects
in the Janm Kundali, though the other Grahas may well be in
their own, Multrikon and exaltation Bhavas.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be in Tula Navamsh, in spite of his being
in exaltation in R&#257;&#347;i, even an emperor’s son will be
jettisoned down to a base position.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya’s position be in Tula 10 degrees, even 1000
Raj Yogas are cancelled.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be in Kanya Navamsh, even an unparalleled
empire will decline.</p>

<p>The native, though belonging to a royal family, if born at
the fall of a meteor, in Vyati Pata, during a roaring thunder,
ar at the sight of a comet will live on alms.</p>

<p>Should Lagn fall in Budh’s Dreshkan and receive a Drishti
from Candr from a Kendr, even a person born in a royal family
will become artisan without any doubt, as declared by the
sages.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be in fall, or in a Navamsh of &#346;ani and
receive a Drishti from &#346;ani, while Candr and S&#363;rya are
in Yuvati Bhava from Lagn, the native along with his mother
serves others.</p>

<p>If Candr is in the Navamsh of S&#363;rya and vice versa,
while both of them are in one R&#257;&#347;i, the native will
have an emaciated body.</p>

<p>According to S&#363;rya, Candr, Mangal and &#346;ani
occupying in their order Randhr, Ari, Dhan and Vyaya Bhava, loss
of eye sight should be predicted through the strongest of the
Grahas, i.e. defect concerning such Grahas’ humour will cause
loss of eye sight.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in Dharm, Labh, Sahaj and Putr Bhava not
receiving a Drishti from benefics, damage of hearing should be
predicted.</p>

<p>One’s teeth will present unsightly look, if malefics be in
Yuvati Bhava (and not receiving Drishti from benefics).</p>

<p>The person will be insane, if &#346;ani is in Lagn, while
Mangal is in Yuvati, Putr, or Dharm Bhava and Candr is
decreasing.</p>

<p>The person will be insane, if S&#363;rya is in the
12<sup>th</sup> from Candr.</p>

<p>Should the 4<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> Bhavas from
&#346;ukr be occupied by malefics, without receiving Drishti
from, or being yuti with benefics, death of the native’s wife
shall take place by fire, confinement, poison etc.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be placed in the midst of two bad Grahas, be
weak and in inimical, or Neech Amsh, the native’s wife will die
by fire, confinement, poison etc.</p>

 in a Kon, while Tanu and Yuvati Bhava are occupied (by some
Grahas), the native will have a disabled wife, will be sorrowful
and addicted to others’ wives.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Lagn, while Candr and &#346;ukr are in the
setting Bhava, i.e. the 7<sup>th</sup> Bhava, one will have a
barren wife.</p>

<p>Should Tanu, Vyaya and Randhr Bhava be occupied by malefics,
while Candr is in Putr Bhava, the native will not have any
children.</p>

<p>When Yuvati’s lord is in Putr Bhava, the native’s wife is
destroyed and he will lose his children.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in Lagn, Putr, Randhr and Vyaya Bhava,
one’s family is destroyed.</p>

<p>Should Budh and &#346;ukr be in Yuvati Bhava, while Bandhu
Bhava is occupied by a malefic Grah and Candr has another
malefic in her 8<sup>th</sup>, the dynasty of the native is
destroyed. Even Guru in Bandhu Bhava cannot save one in such a
circumstance.</p>

<p>Should Randhr’s lord occupy Putr Bhava, while Lagn has a
malefic Grah in it and Bandhu Bhava has Candr there in, with
Putr’s lord being weak, the native will have no descendants.</p>

<p>Should Vyaya Bhava be occupied by weak Candr, or weak
S&#363;rya, one will be one-eyed.</p>

<p>In case S&#363;rya is in Yuvati, or Randhr Bhava, along with
a malefic, there will be eye diseases and tooth decay.</p>

<p>If Bandhu and Putr Bhava contain malefics, Guru is posited in
Vyaya Bhava, while Candr is in Ari, or Randhr Bhava, without
Drishti from, or yuti with benefics, the native will doubtlessly
become blind.</p>

<p>Should Candr be on the meridian, i.e. on the cusp of Karm
Bhava, Mangal be in Yuvati Bhava, while &#346;ani is in the
2<sup>nd</sup> from S&#363;rya, the native will be disabled and
be removes from his caste. (He may change his religion also)</p>

<p>The native will incur leprosy, if Candr is in the Navamsh of
Dhanu, Makar, or Meen. Similar results will have to be expected,
if Lagn Navamsh falls in Vrischik, Kark, Mesh, or Vrishabh and
be yuti with a malefic.</p>

<p>The native will be affected, as far as his private parts are
concerned, if Candr being yuti with a malefic, falls in Kark, or
Vrischik Navamsh. Should Candr be in the 4<sup>th</sup> Navamsh
and be yuti with a malefic Grah, there will be affliction to the
native’s chest, belly and ears.</p>

<p>If Candr is shadowed by Rahu and is placed in Vyaya Bhava
along with a malefic, the native will become insane, tend to
quarrel, or be irritated.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani, posited in a Kendr with strength, give a
Drishti to the lord of Candr R&#257;&#347;i, the person will be
disabled, unlucky and become an ascetic.</p>

<p>If the four Grahas, namely Mangal, S&#363;rya, Guru and
&#346;ani be together, avoiding Lagn, Bandhu, Yuvati, Karm, Putr
and Dharm Bhava (i.e. join in Dhan, Sahaj, Ari, Randhr, Labh, or
Vyaya Bhava, the native will be instrumental for the destruction
of his dynasty, will devoid of wife, sons and money and will
live in foreign countries.</p>

<p>Should one among Guru, Candr and S&#363;rya be in Lagn, or
Karm Bhava, while a malefic is in Vyaya Bhava, even with
ordinary brilliance and receiving a Drishti from an exceedingly
strong &#346;ani, the native will lead men and obtain a holy
order.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in a benefic’s R&#257;&#347;i, or Amsh (or
that of Budh in particular) and be in Drishti to &#346;ani, who
is with strength and going towards the meridian in his own
Bhava, or in his exaltation Bhava, the native will become a
Sanyasin and be not happy.</p>

<p>When Candr is waxing and is with exemplary strength and
Lagn’s lord in Drishti to Mangal, who is devoid of strength, the
native will take to penance, will be grief stricken, be devoid
of wealth and followers and will obtain his food and drink with
difficulty.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord be yuti with S&#363;rya and give a Drishti
to Candr, while Lagn is occupied by &#346;ukr, or Guru and
receives a Drishti from a malefic, the native causes destruction
to the nobility of his birth.</p>

<p>Should &#346;ukr be in depression, or inimical R&#257;&#347;i
and Amsh, a malefic Grah in a Kon and Lagn without good Drishti,
the native will give up his domestic responsibilities, be sagely
in disposition and throughout life will follow other in the
matter of principles (i.e. will not have any of his own).</p>

<p>The several Yogas enumerated, as above should be carefully
evaluated along with the Grah’s strength and weakness, so that
the good, or bad of the Dasha periods are rightly declared.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 24<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Adverse
Combinations for a Janm Kundali” in Horashara of Prithuyasas,
son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=25>Ch. 25. Str&#299; Jatak</a></h2>

<p>The effects of various combinations and Dashas should be
equally applied to both females and males. The effects
applicable to women, as denoted by their Janm Kundalis shall be
restricted to them alone, if those are of such nature. The rest
shall be applicable to their husbands.</p>

<p>The female’s widowhood should be deduced from Randhr Bhava.
Her husband’s luck and happiness are noted from her Yuvati
Bhava. Her appearance is indicated by her Lagn. Her children and
wealth depend on her Dharm Bhava.</p>

<p>Benefic Grahas, which are strong will produce auspicious
results, if they are connected with the said Bhavas.  Malefics
give bad effects in such cases. The Bhavas, that are not
occupied by their lords should be evaluated in such a
manner.</p>

<p>Should both Lagn and Candr be in even R&#257;&#347;i/Amsh
(i.e. female R&#257;&#347;is and Amshas), the girl will possess
a true feminine disposition. If benefics lend their Drishtis, or
join Lagn/Candr, as above, she will be lucky, chaste and
famous.</p>

<p>Trimshamsh effects should be declared with reference to the
strongest of Candr and Lagn. The lord of such Trimshamsh should
also be strong.</p>

<p>The female born in a R&#257;&#347;i of Mangal and in the
Trimshamsh of Mangal will give birth to a dead child and will
not be of good qualities. Should the Trimshamsh be that of Budh
(in Mesh and Vrischik), she will be cunning, will follow dirty
principles and have few issues.</p>

<p>Should the Trimshamsh (in Mesh, or Vrischik) at birth be that
of Guru, she will beget offspring, be burdened by expenses
galore and be dear to her partner. Should the said Trimshamsh be
of &#346;ukr, she will beget daughters and will indulge in
secret (unsanctioned) sexual pleasures.</p>

<p>Being a Mesh, or Vrischik, if born in a Trimshamsh of
&#346;ani, the female will be a servant and be vicious in
several ways. The position of S&#363;rya in Trimshamsh in
similar manner may also yield similar results.</p>

<p>Should the birth in a R&#257;&#347;i of Budh fall in Mangal’s
Trimshamsh area, the female will be addicted to another man. She
will have few issues. And in Budh’s Trimshamsh she will be
supreme of the family and, if in the Trimshamsh of &#346;ukr,
she will have cattle, wealth and luxuries.</p>

<p>In the Trimshamsh of Guru, a female born in a Budh’s
R&#257;&#347;i will be devoted to her husband exclusively, be
dear to him. If Guru is in his own Bhava, or in his exaltation
R&#257;&#347;i, the same effects will prevail. Is she is born in
Budh’s R&#257;&#347;i, in &#346;ani’s Trimshamsh, she will equal
a neuter, will give birth to dead child (or her children will
die) and she will not live with her husband.</p>

<p>If a R&#257;&#347;i of Guru rules at birth, the female born
in the Trimshamsh of Mangal will be a domestic servant and will
be famous, if in the Trimshamsh of Guru, she will be very rich
and in Budh’s Trimshamsh she will be adored by all. She will
have sons, if the Trimshamsh be of &#346;ukr. She will also be
virtuous and dear to her husband.  The Trimshamsh of &#346;ani
will make her poor, beget daughters and independent at all
times.</p>

<p>When birth falls in a R&#257;&#347;i of &#346;ukr in the
Trimshamsh of Mangal, she will be wicked, like quarrels, hate
her husband and will have a bad history. If the Trimshamsh is
that of Budh, she will take pleasure in poetry, arts, singing
and playing instruments; she will be beautiful and virtuous. She
will be bestowed with husband, sons and wealth, if the
Trimshamsh is that of Guru. Should the Trimshamsh belong to
&#346;ukr, she will have all luxuries, be sharp and dear to all.
If the birth is in &#346;ani’s Trimshamsh, she will remarry. She
will beget dead children of lose children and be always
sick.</p>

<p>Now a R&#257;&#347;i of &#346;ani at birth.  Should the
Trimshamsh belong to Mangal, she will be a servant, an unchaste
woman and she will be getting dead children. Budh’s Trimshamsh
indicates, that she will not be loyal to her husband, be
unchaste and cunning.  She will be dear to her husband, lucky
and widely famous, if born in Guru’s Trimshamsh. If born in the
Trimshamsh of &#346;ukr, she will be of lordly disposition, be
barren and be devoid of good history. She will take to bad
traditions and will be very unlucky, if born in &#346;ani’s
Trimshamsh.</p>

<p>With regard to those females born in Simh:  In the Trimshamsh
of Mangal, she will be very talkative, unchaste, be in distant
places and will resemble men in appearance and qualities. In the
Trimshamsh of Budh, she will be devoted to her work, but be not
chaste. She will be dear to king, will not have many issues and
be always sick, if born in the Trimshamsh of &#346;ukr. She will
be healthy and poor, if &#346;ani is the ruler of Trimshamsh.
She will be liked by the king, if born in Guru’s Trimshamsh.</p>

<p>Now the various Trimshamshas of Kark at birth. She will be
self-willed, sensual and will lose children, if the Trimshamsh
is that of Mangal. The issues and longevity are limited by
Guru’s Trimshamsh. Budh’s Trimshamsh will make her an artisan.
She will be either barren, or have children dead, if it is
&#346;ukr’s Trimshamsh.  &#346;ani’s Trimshamsh will deprive of
her husband and she will eke out her food with difficulty.</p>

<p>The Jyotishi should predict the effects of Trimshamsh, as
detailed above. Such Trimshamsh effects should be predicted
through Candr and S&#363;rya, or through Lagn and Candr.</p>

<p>One’s husband will be wretched, if Yuvati Bhava is vacant, be
weak and receives a Drishti from malefics, but not from
benefics.</p>

<p>Should Budh and &#346;ani be in Yuvati Bhava, she will beget
a husband equal to a neuter. She will be barren and unlucky. She
will always be away. Should Yuvati Bhava be a movable
R&#257;&#347;i, or its lord is placed in such Navamsh, her
husband will like to be away from home; and a fixed
R&#257;&#347;i will make him stick to home.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya be in Yuvati Bhava, she will be given up by
her husband. Early widowhood is caused by Mangal in Yuvati
Bhava. If &#346;ani is in Yuvati Bhava and receives a Drishti
from malefics, she will remain unmarried, or she will become a
widow and go to other men.</p>

<p>Another marriage to a woman is indicated, if Yuvati Bhava is
occupied by both malefics and benefics. She will become a widow,
if both Mangal and &#346;ani are in Yuvati Bhava owned by a
malefic.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and Rahu be in Yuvati Bhava, the lady will
have many husbands. If a malefic is in Yuvati Bhava without
strength and benefic Drishti, she will be given up by her
husband and, if the said Grah be also in depression, she will be
inimical to her husband.</p>

<p>Should there be exchange of Navamshas between Mangal and
&#346;ukr, the female will be secretly addicted to other men. If
she has Candr in Yuvati Bhava simultaneously, her husband also
will be so.</p>

<p>If Candr and &#346;ukr be together in Lagn, belonging to
Mangal, or &#346;ani, while Putr Bhava is occupied be a malefic,
the woman in question will be barren.</p>

<p>If Mangal placed in Yuvati Bhava, or in the 7<sup>th</sup>
Navamsh, receives a Drishti from &#346;ani, or, if &#346;ani
receiving a Drishti from Mangal is similarly posited, the female
will have diseased vagina. She will also be unfortunate.</p>

<p>Should Yuvati Bhava be owned and receives a Drishti from a
benefic and similarly the 7<sup>th</sup> Navamsh, the female
will belong to a supremely classified lot and will be dear to
her husband without any doubt.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya is in its own Bhava in Yuvati Bhava, or in the
7<sup>th</sup> Amsh, the husband of such a lady will be
sensually disposed and soft in speech. Candr in similar
condition indicates a soft spoken husband, who will be at the
disposal of another lady. Mangal in such a case gives a poor
husband, who is addicted to other women. Budh in similar
position gives a learned and happy husband. A virtuous husband,
who has his five senses under control is indicated by Guru. The
female gets a lucky and happy husband, who has &#346;ukr in
similar position. &#346;ani disposed thus gives an old man and a
dunce, as husband. Thus should be guessed about the husband of
the female, who has these Grahas in Yuvati Bhava.</p>

<p>Whatever has been said about Yuvati Bhava and Lagn should be
combined with the various combinations in Janm Kundalis of the
couple and results should be declared accordingly.</p>

<p>If Lagn is owned by a benefic (also means Budh) and is
occupied by Candr and &#346;ukr, the female will be happy, but
will hate her husband. She will always be on the move.</p>

<p>Should Candr and Budh be in Lagn, she will be a supreme
person of the race and will be an exponent of Vedic Science. If
&#346;ukr and Budh are posited in Lagn, she will be lucky and a
supreme person of the race. Should Budh, Candr and &#346;ukr be
in Lagn, the female will have abundant comforts and money. Guru
in Lagn gives her exceeding wealth, prosperity and sons.</p>

<p>Should a Grah in Lagn be in its own Bhava, or in exaltation,
this will prove auspicious, even though it may be malefic in
nature.</p>

<p>Should a malefic be in Randhr Bhava, widowhood is caused. A
Drishti from another malefic there to makes it all the more
certain. The Dasha of the lord of the Navamsh occupied by
Randhr’s lord will surely bring forth widowhood to a female.</p>

<p>If a benefic Grah is in Randhr Bhava, the woman predeceases
her husband. Both the husband and wife quit the world at a time,
if the female has both benefic and malefic in Randhr Bhava. The
strength and weakness of the Grahas should be wisely
understood.</p>

<p>Though there be malefics in Yuvati, or Randhr Bhava, a
benefic in Dharm Bhava in a female’s Janm Kundali will give her
happiness concerning her husband and issue. She will along with
her husband have a long lease of life.</p>

<p>Should Dhanu, Kark, or Meen, rise at birth, the female will
be a source of misery to her husband and issue.</p>

<p>If Candr is in Putr Bhava identical with Simh, Vrischik,
Vrishabh, or Kanya, the female will have not many issues. This
is equally true in regard to males also.</p>

<p>Malefics posited in Lagn, Yuvati, Randhr and Dharm Bhava will
give only bad results. Should these Bhavas be devoid of
benefics, the female will always be subjected to grievous
effects.</p>

<p>Should a malefic be in Bandhu Bhava, the female will deliver
many times. At the time of giving a girl away in marriage,
whatever ways have been laid earlier, should be consulted.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 25 Ch. entitled “Stree Jatak” in Horashara of
Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=26>Ch. 26. On Death</a></h2>

<p>All the creatures will face death for some reason, or other.
To decide the reasons, the several indications are to be known
thus: Note the Grah occupying Randhr Bhava. If it is S&#363;rya,
the death is through fire; if it is Candr: fire; if it is
Mangal: weapons; if it is Budh: fall; if it is Guru: fever; if
it is &#346;ukr: indigestion; and, if it is &#346;ani: hunger.
Depending in Randhr Bhava being a movable, fixed, or dual
R&#257;&#347;i, death will be in foreign, in one’s own house,
or, while on the move.</p>

<p>The death of a native will be due to so many afflictions, as
the Grahas are many in Randhr Bhava. The Grahas in Randhr Bhava
from the stronger of Lagn, or Candr are to be considered (for
purpose of death).</p>

<p>The death of a native may be expected through the humour
(wind, phlegm, or bile) belonging to Randhr Bhava, or the
Navamsh occupied by Randhr’s lord.</p>

<p>Should the R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh referred to above be
Mesh, death will be caused by fever, poison, defects of
digestive fire and bile. The humour causing death will be
according to the Grah joining, or giving a Drishti.</p>

<p>Should such a R&#257;&#347;i/Navamsh be, the Vrishabh death
will be die to the three humours, weapons, thirst etc. This is
so, when the R&#257;&#347;i/Navamsh above is not occupied by any
Grah. If occupied, the humour of the Grah concerned will
prevail.</p>

<p>Should it be Mithun R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh, death will be
due to cough, breathing troubles, diseases generated by heat,
colics etc. The R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh of Candr indicates
death due to rheumatic pains, mental affliction, diarrhoea
etc.</p>

<p>Should the R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh be Simh, death will be
through tumor, poison, weapon etc., or fever. Kanya in such case
will cause death through defects in digestive fire, or private
parts, disputes, or fall.</p>

<p>Should it be Tula, death will be through the blunders
committed by his thoughts, fever, delirium, or the effects of
the Dasha ruling at that time.</p>

<p>Should it be Vrischik, death will be due to jaundice and
defective spleen etc. Should it be Dhanu having a malefic there
in, death will be through a tree, water, weapon, wood etc.</p>

<p>If it is Makar R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh, death is due to
hit by spear or, while tilling lands, or by mental aberration.
Should it be yuti with a malefic, death is through wild animals,
like tiger, fever, cough, consumption (pulmonary disease) and in
unnatural circumstances i.e. man-made.</p>

<p>Should it be Kumbh R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh and be with
malefic, death will be through tigers, weapons, snakes etc.  and
cough, fever, consumption etc.</p>

<p>Should it be Meen R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh, death will be
due to snakes, journey, wind machinery, collision of a steamer
in the mid-waters, or through the roaring thunders.</p>

<p>Death should normally happen due to dysentery, fever, thirst,
diseases of the stomach, poison, lack of continued food,
breakage and diseases in the body.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in her fateful degrees, as mentioned before
identical with Lagn, Vyaya Bhava, or Randhr Bhava, death should
be expected through water, machinery etc.</p>

<p>If Candr and S&#363;rya are posited in Lagn in a dual
(common) R&#257;&#347;i (i.e. Mithun, Kanya, Dhanu, or Meen) and
be yuti with, or receives a Drishti from a malefic Grah, the
native’s life ends surely in the midst of water.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Bandhu Bhava, while Candr is in Yuvati
Bhava and Mangal is in Karm Bhava, death will take place by
falling down from a tree, or in a well.</p>

<p>If Candr is in Mesh, Vrischik, Makar, or Kumbh, between two
malefics and without any Drishti from benefics, death will be by
ropes, thunderbolt, weapons etc. The same result follows, if
Candr is in Kanya.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in Bandhu and Karm Bhava and benefics in
Randhr Bhava, or Lagn, death will be by implement through a
spear, or trident, or by rheumatic heart, cardiac arrest etc.
(Hridayashula).</p>

<p>Should &#346;ani be in Vyaya, Ari, Randhr, or Bandhu Bhava
along with Candr, the native’s end occurs in the sea. Two
malefics surrounding Randhr Bhava may also bring about such a
death.</p>

<p>If there are malefics in the Konas from Lagn, or from Candr,
or, if Rahu is in Randhr Bhava, death will be caused by
hanging.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya and Rahu are in Lagn, while Candr is in
Ari/Randhr Bhava and malefics are posited in Vyaya Bhava, death
will take place through poison, or weapon.</p>

<p>If Rahu is placed in Bandhu, or Randhr Bhava and receives a
Drishti from the lord of Randhr Bhava, or, if Randhr Bhava is
occupied by malefic, or receives a Drishti from such a Grah,
death is indicated by poison, weapon, or fire.</p>

<p>Death by hanging is indicated, if S&#363;rya is in Yuvati
Bhava along with Rahu, or Ketu, while &#346;ukr is in Randhr
Bhava.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord be in a Kendr and surrounded by two
malefics, while Randhr Bhava is tenanted by a Grah, death is
caused by one’s own anger.</p>

<p>If S&#363;rya is in Lagn, while &#346;ani is in Putr Bhava
and Mangal is in Dhan, or Dharm Bhava the native’s death is
caused by a tree, thunderbolt, or a wall.</p>

<p>Death by fall of a log is indicated, if decreasing Candr is
in Randhr Bhava, S&#363;rya is in Bandhu Bhava, &#346;ani in
Yuvati Bhava and Mangal in Dhan Bhava.</p>

<p>If decreasing Candr is in Karm Bhava, while Mangal is in
Dharm Bhava, &#346;ani is ascending and S&#363;rya is in Putr
Bhava, death will be by fire, or remaining in bondage.</p>

<p>Should Mangal be in Tula, while S&#363;rya is in
Mesh/Vrischik and Candr is in one of the R&#257;&#347;is of
Mangal, or &#346;ani, death will take place amidst filth.</p>

<p>The death of a native will be through royal displeasure, or
one’s own weapons, if Mangal is in Bandhu Bhava, S&#363;rya is
in Yuvati Bhava, &#346;ani is in Karm Bhava, while Randhr Bhava
has some Grah in it.</p>

<p>If &#346;ani is in Dhan, or in Bandhu Bhava, while Candr is
in Karm Bhava and Mangal is in Yuvati Bhava, death of the native
will be caused by worms.</p>

<p>Should Bandhu and Karm Bhava contain malefics, while the
decreasing Candr is in Randhr, Vyaya, or Ari Bhava, the native’s
end will occur, while he is on journey, or through a
thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya and Mangal be in Vyaya Bhava, Candr and
Rahu in Yuvati and Guru in a Kendr, the native will die in a
distant place, or in a temple, or garden.</p>

<p>Should the lord of Randhr be in Randhr Bhava, identical with
a watery R&#257;&#347;i, or in Ari, or in Vyaya Bhava, the
native’s death will be through cruel animals, snakes, or through
falling in a well or, while in his own abode.</p>

<p>If Ketu is in Randhr Bhava, while Randhr’s lord is in a
Kendr, malefics in Vyaya Bhava and Lagn’s lord is devoid of
strength, the native’s death will be due to his resorting to bad
ways.</p>

<p>Should Lagn be in Visha Ghatika Muhurta, while Randhr Bhava
has a malefic in it, the death will be through poison, fire, or
weapon. The same results can be expected, if Randhr’s lord is
fateful in degree yuti with a malefic.</p>

<p>Should Mangal and &#346;ani exchange their R&#257;&#347;is,
or Navamshas, be in fateful degrees (of those R&#257;&#347;is
occupied by them) and are placed In Kendras (from Lagn), the
native’s death will be through sovereign wrath, or by being
impaled by a spear, or some such killing weapons.</p>

<p>Should Candr be in Lagn, S&#363;rya in Randhr without
strength, Guru in Vyaya Bhava, while a malefic is in Bandhu
Bhava, the native’s death will take place following the removal
of his hands and eyes, or through weapons by mean elements at
night.</p>

<p>If Mangal and Budh are posited in Randhr Bhava, while Lagn’s
lord is in the R&#257;&#347;i, or Amsh of a benefic Grah, the
native’s death takes place through flies, venomous reptiles
etc.</p>

<p>Should there be many Grahas in Bandhu Bhava, while Randhr’s
lord and Lagn’s lord are together, the death of the native will
come to pass along with many persons.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord be yuti with Putr’s lord and Randhr’s lord
in any R&#257;&#347;i, the native will die along with his son.
If it is a combination of Lagn’s lord, Yuvati’s lord and
Randhr’s lord, the native dies along with his wife.</p>

<p>Naturally, if a Dasha is at its end, the death will occur in
a simple way (i.e. not by cruel, or painful means and in the mid
of an untoward Grah’s Dasha death will be cruel corresponding to
Randhr Bhava.</p>

<p>The place of death will correspond to the R&#257;&#347;i, or
Navamsh, or Randhr’s lord. According to the R&#257;&#347;i and
Amsh, the place, whether on land, or in water and the direction
of death should be guessed.</p>

<p>If Lagn is a R&#257;&#347;i, which is strong in nights, death
will come to pass in a night. And day R&#257;&#347;is at birth
will bring about the end in day time. If Lagn is vacant, these
results will come to pass. If, however, there be a Grah, the
effects relating to that Grah shall also be weighed.</p>

<p>The state of unconsciousness preceding one’s death will
correspond to the Navamshas elapsed (i.e. the period in terms of
Navamshas passed in the particular natal Lagn), this is, when a
benefic is in Lagn. If Randhr’s lord is in his own, or
exaltation R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh, it has to be trebled.</p>

<p>When Lagn’s lord is in a watery Navamsh, or a watery
R&#257;&#347;i, Candr, or &#346;ukr give a Drishti to Bandhu
Bhava and Randhr and Vyaya Bhava are occupied by malefics, the
native will be killed in the middle of water, i.e. mid-river
etc.</p>

<p>Should Lagn’s lord be in Randhr Bhava in Navamsh, or be
combust, or even in an enemy’s R&#257;&#347;i, one will die in a
country, where one has no relatives and in a natural course.</p>

<p>Note Navamsh’s lord occupied by Lagn’s lord. If the said
Navamsh’s lord is posited in Lagn in Janm Kundali along with
Lagn’s lord, or receiving a Drishti from Lagn’s lord, death will
occur in a place other than the one of birth. Lagn and its lord
can also be replaced with Candr R&#257;&#347;i lord in the said
combination.</p>

<p>Should the natal Lagn be in a Bhava of Guru, or in such
Vargas, the soul attains heavens. If a R&#257;&#347;i of
&#346;ukr, or the R&#257;&#347;i of Candr be Lagn, the departed
soul reached the Mane’s world. If a R&#257;&#347;i of Mangal, or
Simh be the natal Lagn, mortal’s world will receive the soul.
Should Ketu ascend, the person goes to Mrityu’s Loka, i.e. hell.
Should Budh and his R&#257;&#347;i ascend, one will assume the
kind of a brutal animal. Should &#346;ani, or Rahu ascend, or,
if &#346;ani’s R&#257;&#347;i is Lagn, the person is destined to
take rebirth, as a devil etc.</p>

<p>Should a R&#257;&#347;i be without any Grah in it, or does
not receive a Drishti from a Grah, the effects arising out of
the ownership of the Bhava of the Grah (and the effects due to
that Grah’s nature) will prevail.</p>

<p>Should Guru be at the end of Lagn or, if S&#363;rya is in
Lagn owned by Guru, the native will attain final emancipation
i.e. the Lord’s Lotus Feet.</p>

<p>Whenever (something) has been stated in works about Jyotish
relating to auspicious effects, that has been stated here (in
this work).</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 26<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “On Death” in
Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=27>Ch. 27. Lost Horoscopy</a></h2>

<p>If a querist does not have the knowledge of his birth year,
Ayana, Ritu, month etc., Paksh, day, Navamsh, Dwadashamsh, Lagn,
Star and Janm R&#257;&#347;i, he can gain the information from a
Jyotishi. The querist should come to the Jyotishi, when the sky
is clear (i.e.  cloudless) with dakshina, flowers, fruits etc.
and declare such a purpose. The clarity of the sky is a good
augury for Prashn. One should not give predictions, when there
is a state of cloud in the sky, rain, thunder etc. The offerings
of flowers etc. are considered to be good omens.</p>

<p>The Jyotishi should work out the Lagn prevailing for the time
of query (which is called Arudh Lagn, or Prashn Lagn) after
evaluating (the sincerity of the querist and the omens existing
around.  From these (i.e. from the Kundali cast for the time of
query) the birth year, Ayan, month, Nakshatr and the
R&#257;&#347;i can be estimated through several principles.</p>

<p>The Navamsh position of Guru will correspond to the Arudh
Lagn Navamsh, or the Udaya Lagn (the strongest of the two), or
the Konas from there.</p>

<p>All the above details can be guessed, as explained below
after an estimation of the querist’s age. Should the Prashn Lagn
be in the first half of that R&#257;&#347;i, the birth should
have been in Uttarayan, i.e., when S&#363;rya is in northern
course. Should it be the second half, the birth should have been
in Dakshinayan, i.e. during S&#363;rya’s southerly course. That
is how an Jyotishi should tell the querist.</p>

<p>The Ritu of birth should be understood through the Grah in
Lagn, or the Dreshkan lord from there. The three seasons of
Uttarayan are ruled by &#346;ani, &#346;ukr, or Mangal, while in
Dakshinayan the three lords are Candr, Budh and Guru. Should
S&#363;rya be in Lagn, or the Hora, or Dreshkan rising at the
time of query, the querist was born in Geeshma Ritu. This is
true, when the same (i.e S&#363;rya in Lagn etc.) does not
receive a Drishti from, or is not yuti with any other Grah.
Should the Ritu not suit the Ayan, the Ritu’s of Candr, Budh and
Guru should be altered with that of &#346;ukr, Mangal and
&#346;ani, respectively.</p>

<p>Should the Prashn Lagn be in the first five degrees of the
Dreshkan, the birth should have been in the first month of the
Ritu, if in the second half of the Dreshkan, the birth was in
the second month of the Ritu. If the querist faces the
north-east and touches the right side of the body, the birth was
in Uttarayan and, if he touches the left side of the body, the
birth was in Dakshinayan. The Ritu can be guessed by the flowers
touched in addition to the above. Similarly through the portion
of the body touched by the querist, the Ayan can be guessed.
Should he touch the upper portion, it is Uttarayan and, if he
touches the lower portion, this indicates Dakshinayan. By a
repeated touch, the month can be guessed. If two estimations by
two different methods coincide, then it is only true.</p>

<p>If the Prashn Lagn is Vrischik, or Kumbh, or Kanya, or Meen,
or Simh, or Tula, the birth should have been in the night.</p>

<p>If the Prashn Lagn is among Vrishabh, Kark, Mithun, Makar, or
Dhanu, or Ravi Hora, it is a day birth.</p>

<p>If Meen rises in R&#257;&#347;i, or Navamsh at the time of
query, the birth should have been at sunset, or at a time, when
day starts (i.e. sunrise), or at mid-day, or at midnight.</p>

<p>The number of degrees past in the Prashn Lagn, or the degrees
traversed by Candr at the time of query will correspond to the
Ghatis passed from sunrise, or from sunset at birth.</p>

<p>The upper portion of the body represents a movable
R&#257;&#347;i, the middle portion a fixed R&#257;&#347;i and
the lower portion a dual R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>The Lagn at birth can be determined according to the part of
the body, viz. head etc., touched by the querist, or based on
the eatables, if bought by the querist, or the appearances, that
may be noted at that time, or any hue, heard at that time.</p>

<p>Note the R&#257;&#347;i occupied by the strongest Grah and
its position with reference to Prashn Lagn. So many
R&#257;&#347;is away from that Grah will the natal Lagn be.</p>

<p>Possibly, the Prashn Lagn, or it Konas can also correspond to
the natal Lagn, or the R&#257;&#347;i, from which a Grah lends
its Drishti to Prashn Lagn can also be the natal Lagn.
Alternatively, the R&#257;&#347;i owned by the Grah in Prashn
Lagn may coincide with Janm Lagn.</p>

<p>Note the number of R&#257;&#347;is between Prashn Lagn and
the lagn at sunrise on the day of the query. So many stars
counted from Ashvini will be the natal star.</p>

<p>Multiply by 2 the difference of R&#257;&#347;is between
Prashn Lagn and Udaya Lagn. To this product, add the number
denoted by the ruling Nakshatr at the time of query. Divide the
final product by 27 and the remainder will represent the birth
star counted from Ashvini.</p>

<p>The Prashn Matras (i.e. the value of the words uttered by the
querist) should be added twice and thrice and be divided by 27.
The remainder counted from Ashvini will reveal the natal
star.</p>

<p>The rays for the 12 R&#257;&#347;is from Mesh are 9, 8, 14,
8, 11, 9, 6, 7, 5, 10, 8 and 14, respectively. For the Grahas
from S&#363;rya these are 20, 18, 12, 14, 8, 18 and 10. Thus,
ancient sages say.</p>

<p>The figure denoted by the rays for Prashn Lagn (i.e. the rays
for the said R&#257;&#347;i) should be multiplied by the figure
denoted by the rays for the Grah there in. Divide the product by
12. The remainder will indicate the Janm R&#257;&#347;i counted
from Mesh. Similar process to Udaya Lagn will yield the Nakshatr
at birth, when divided by 27.</p>

<p>If there is no Grah in the said R&#257;&#347;i, it should be
multiplied by the figure of rays of the Grah and the resultant
product be divided by 27. The remainder left thus should be
treated, as Nakshatr. Instead of 27 divide by 12 to get the Janm
R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>The figures of the R&#257;&#347;i, which is Lagn at the time
of query should be added to the Grah concerned. The product
should be divided by 27; the remainder indicates birth star,
when counted from Ashvini.</p>

<h2><a name=30>Ch. 30. Effects of Birth in the Several Amshas</a></h2>

<p>The native whose Lagn falls in Mesh Navamsh will be
mischievous, mean, will be weak sighted, not peaceful, bilious
in temperament and sensuously disposed. Birth in Mesh Amsh will
confer malefic results, or diseases in the 12<sup>th</sup>,
25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, or 65<sup>th</sup> year of
age.</p>

<p>The native with Vrishabh Navamsh will be wise, will enjoy
pleasures and will have a big stomach. He will be strong,
long-faced, will walk awkwardly, will have moving eye-balls
(from one side to the other) and will possess many daughters.
Difficulties and diseases can be expected in the
22<sup>nd</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 23<sup>rd</sup>, or
72<sup>nd</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>Should the birth be in Mithun Navamsh, one will be brilliant
in appearance, eloquent, fickleminded, proficient in Shastras,
will enjoy pleasures, be modest, be unsteady about women, very
intelligent and will have no wife. Death can be expected in
either the 16<sup>th</sup> year, or the 24<sup>th</sup>,
34<sup>th</sup>, 63<sup>rd</sup>, or the 40<sup>th</sup>
year.</p>

<p>The native of Kark Navamsh will be angrily disposed, will
have grotesque body, be wealthy, will possess crooked sight,
will be intent on living in foreign countries. will help his

<p>The native, who has Simh Navamsh at birth will live in a
manless zone, be very self-respected, will have thin belly, will
have knowledge of everything in the world, will have weak teeth,

phlegmatic diseases and be poor. Evils shall occur in his
3<sup>rd</sup> year, 23<sup>rd</sup> year, 46<sup>th</sup> year,
27<sup>th</sup> year, 38<sup>th</sup> year and 76<sup>th</sup>
year of age.</p>

<p>One born in Vrischik Navamsh will not have his elders, be
mischievous, wise, weak sighted, cruel, will indulge in sinful
acts secretly, long-bodied and round bellied. His
18<sup>th</sup>, 23<sup>rd</sup>, 13<sup>th</sup>,
70<sup>th</sup>, or the 55<sup>th</sup> year will be doubtful
about longevity.</p>

<p>One born with Dhanu Navamsh will have self-earned money, be
virtuous, long-necked, lazy and be satisfied with anything
small. He will have a big nose, will talk much and be lord of
wealth.  There will be danger to his life, or sickness in this
16<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>,
36<sup>th</sup>, or 72<sup>nd</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>The native of Makar Navamsh will be short bodied,
fickleminded, mischievous, less bold, unfortunate in regard to
wife and enjoy greatly. His 19<sup>th</sup>, 27<sup>th</sup>,
34<sup>th</sup>, 49<sup>th</sup> and 68<sup>th</sup> years of
age will bring diseases. So have said the sages.</p>

<p>One born in Kumbh Navamsh will be slanderous, not kind,
cunning, weak, long-bodied, a wanderer, always troubled by
expenses and mentally depressed. At the age of 14, 20, 28, 32,
61, or 7, there will be doubt about his life.</p>

<p>The native of Meen Navamsh will be after women, will have an
emaciated body, will live through water (i.e. profession related
to water), will be fish bellied, scholarly and will live in
others’ houses. He will be wealthy and possess many wives. Death
can be expected in his 10<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>,
21<sup>st</sup>, 26<sup>th</sup>, 52<sup>nd</sup>, or the
61<sup>st</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>According to sages, normally the 59<sup>th</sup> year,
32<sup>nd</sup> year and the 8<sup>th</sup> year shall bring
evils to a native.</p>

<p>During the sub-period of a malefic Grah, if it be also in an
evil R&#257;&#347;i, death, or serious disease should be
predicted.</p>

<p>Whatever results have been attributed to birth in various
R&#257;&#347;is, shall equally apply to Dwadashamsh also.
Should a Grah be in Vargothama Navamsh, happy and two-fold
results are revealed.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 30<sup>th</sup> Ch. entitled “Effects of Birth
in the Several Amshas” in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah
Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=31>Ch. 31. Nakshatr Jataka</a></h2>

<p>The Dasha periods, in the scheme of Nakshatr Dasha, otherwise
known, as Udu Dasha, or Vimshottari Dasha, are: 6, 10, 7, 18,
16, 19, 17, 7 and 20 years, respectively, for S&#363;rya, Candr,
Mangal, Rahu, Guru, &#346;ani, Budh, Ketu and &#346;ukr. These
Dashas are lorded by the Grahas in the above order, counted from
the Nakshatr Kritika.</p>

<p>The order of the Dashas counts from one’s birth Nakshatr
(i.e. the one occupied by Candr), or the Nakshatr, in which Lagn
is rising at birth. The ending periods of all the Grahas will be
normally evil.</p>

<p>During the conclusion of the Dashas of S&#363;rya, Mangal,
&#346;ani and Rahu, there will be diseases, destruction of
wealth, disputes and evil incidents. The native’s death can
occur during the Dasha of a Grah yuti with a malefic, or with
Randhr’s lord.</p>

<p>The Dasha of the particular Nakshatr, which is occupied by a
malefic Grah, will bring about sorrow. The extent traversed in
the said Nakshatr by the said cruel Grah will indicate the
possible time.</p>

<p>In the three groups of Nakshatras, if there is a weak malefic
without Drishti from a benefic, such Dasha will cause death in
its end.</p>

<p>In the Dasha of a Grah occupying R&#257;&#347;i Sandhi (i.e.
the area, where one R&#257;&#347;i ends and the other one
starts), there will be diseases. In the end of the Dasha of the
Grah, that heads towards the 30<sup>th</sup> degree of the
R&#257;&#347;i concerned, death will take place.</p>

<p>The portion still to elapse in the Janm Nakshatr should be
multiplied by the Dasha years (as mentioned in Sloka 1 of this
Ch.) and divided by 60. The quotient will indicate the years to
lapse, as yet in the Dasha concerned. Similar calculations
should be made through the remainder to ascertain the months
etc.</p>

<p>The Dasha effects should be predicted in the same order (from
the balance of Janm Dasha obtained, as per Sloka 17). To obtain
the Bhukti period of one Grah in the Dasha of another multiply
the figure of years mutually and divide by 120. The Bhukti
period is years is revealed. The effects of Antar Dashas stated
earlier, should be applied.</p>

<p>The results of Ketu will be, like that of Mangal, while
Rahu’s effects will be, like &#346;ani’s. The other Grahas
produce even effects due to their nature. Thus, the good and bad
of the Dashas should be understood.</p>

<p>The effects of the Nakshatras (i.e.  Vimshottari Dasha
system) is acceptable to all, as stated. After very minutely
examining these, the Dasha results should be predicted.</p>

<p>Should S&#363;rya in transit reach the R&#257;&#347;i
occupied by the Bhukti lord at birth, the effects will be marked
to the particular Dasha.</p>

<p>The effects should be calculated from the stronger of the
two, i.e. Candr and Lagn at birth.</p>

<p><i>Thus ends the 31<sup>st</sup> Ch. entitled “Nakshatr Jataka”
in Horashara of Prithuyasas, son of Varah Mihira.</i></p>

<h2><a name=32>Ch. 32. Jataka Lakshanas</a></h2>

<p>The Jyotishi should in a clean, lonely place, where there is
no movement of people, comfortably be seated and salute his
preceptor, Ganesh and all the nine Grahas.</p>

<p>He should maintain silence and have lofty notions. He should
face the Sun-God. He should note all the omens, as instructed by
Siddhasena.</p>

<p>A weapon’s hit, quarrel, fall and cry, or grief are
considered ominous. Astrological calculations made at that time
portend death, separation and loss of wealth.</p>

<p>A snake, a chameleon, an alligator, a skull of a naked person
are all evil, if sighted. A mention about these will indicate
evil and danger.</p>

<p>The cry of a lizard on the left and a sneezing on a side
other than the left are indicative of evil. Death is hinted, if
the sound of a fox, buffalo, or a cow is heard in the near-by
area.</p>

<p>The good and evil results should be judged with the help of
above omens and the queries can be correctly answered within a
limit of two years.</p>

<p>The Jyotishi should calculate the position of the Grahas,
after knowing the age, month, natal Nakshatr, Lagn, Hora etc. He
should also note the number of days elapsed (on the day of birth
etc.) since the beginning of Kali Yuga.</p>

<p>Pita Maha Siddhanta’s calculations should be carefully
adopted to know the slow and fast motions (preceding and
following their retrogressions), retrograde motion, combustion
in S&#363;rya. (heliacal) rising, whether at war etc.</p>

<p>The Jyotishi should make calculations regarding the
Dreshkanas, Navamshas, Dwadashamshas, Trimshamshas etc., after
ascertaining the minutest details mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>The results due to S&#363;rya and Mangal will be revealed in
the beginning by itself, while Budh, Guru and &#346;ani give
effects at the end. Candr reveals, while rising and the effects
of &#346;ukr depend on its motion.</p>

<p>The position of &#346;ukr at the time of retrogression and
immediately before and after retrogression is not possible to be
exactly known. The Jyotishi should correctly work out the same
through various systems and ascertain the placement of &#346;ukr
in the heavens.</p>

<p>To know the Navamsh position of a Grah, multiply its
longitude by (?) and divide by 12 and the Navamsh position is
revealed.</p>

<p>The longitude of a Grah should be multiplied by 12. Add to
the product the longitude of the Grah and divide by 12. The
process will reveal the R&#257;&#347;i, Amsh sphutas of the
Grah.</p>

<p>To Candr’s position, add one eleventh of S&#363;rya’s
longitude and one fourth for other Grahas. If &#346;ukr and Budh
are combust, or are rising after heliacal setting, or are
retrograde, then addition of subtraction should be made by
doubling S&#363;rya’s longitude and not otherwise.</p>

<p>The Sun-God should be worshipped by offering red flowers,
Akshata and Sandal with folded hands and then the Grahas should
be worshipped. The querist after doing so shall honour the
Jyotishi according to his capacity.</p>

<p>The querist should say: I want to ascertain the span of my
life, the past, the future and the present, the auspicious and
inauspicious events. I want to hear all these through your
mercy.</p>

<p>The Jyotishi should begin in a good Muhurta, when Candr and
her Nakshatr are beneficially disposed and give a written
account to the querist of his longevity etc.</p>

<p>The R&#257;&#347;i Mandala (i.e. the firmaments), the Grahas
and the movements are well effective. The Jyotishi and the Kala
Purush shall be duly presented.</p>

<p>The entire work is constructed by me after studying the
several Shastras of the ancestors. The essence has been abridged
for increasing the wisdom of the readers and should there be
anything inconsistent, the noble may forgive me.</p>

<p>Just, as Candr was taken out of the (Milk) ocean by churning
with the Mandara mountain, I have produced this essence after
riddling the ocean of Jyotish.</p>
