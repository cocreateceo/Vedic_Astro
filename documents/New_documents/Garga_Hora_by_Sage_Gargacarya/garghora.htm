<h1>Garga Hor&#257; by Sage Garg&#257;c&#257;rya</h1>
<p><br><p><br>


<p>Jupiter in his own house along with Saturn and Mercury will
bestow long life. Such native often will beget wealth.</p>

<p>Should Venus be in Pisces along with Jupiter and the Moon,
the native will acquire kingly fortunes and will have many sons
and family.</p>

<p>Should the Ascendant be in a malefic R&#257;&#347;i, while
the Lord thereof occupies the 7<sup>th</sup> house and Jupiter
is posited in the 8<sup>th</sup> along with the Sun, the child
will die at the age of eight.</p>

<p>If Mercury and Mars be together in the Ascendant, or
6<sup>th</sup>, or 8<sup>th</sup>, the native will either be a
thief, or will indulge in awful acts. Such a person will have
defect in his hands and legs.</p>

<p>Mercury in the Ascendant, or 6<sup>th</sup>, or
8<sup>th</sup> can cause death at the age of 4. Even if the
native is dipped in nectar, it will be of no avail.</p>

<p>Mars and Jupiter in exchange in R&#257;&#347;i will inflict
death at the age of 12. Even though Lord Siva may desire to save
the person, it is rare to escape death in such a case.</p>

<p>Should Jupiter occupy a house of Mars identical with
2<sup>nd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, or 8<sup>th</sup> from Lagna,
this child doubtlessly will face death in its sixth year.</p>

<p>If Rahu occupies the Ascendant at birth, while the Moon is in
the 6<sup>th</sup>/9<sup>th</sup>, the child will die within 20
days of birth. Similar effects will prevail, if Rahu is in the
4<sup>th</sup> from Lagna, while the Moon occupies one of the
angles.</p>

<p>Death will be inflicted by Rahu in the 7<sup>th</sup> from
Lagna, while the Moon is in the Ascendant. Even nectar will not
be useful to him and the death will come to pass in the
10<sup>th</sup> year of the child.</p>

<p>If the Moon is in the 12<sup>th</sup> from Lagna, while
malefics are in the 6<sup>th</sup> house, the native will be
shortlived. He will suffer from stomachial disorders.</p>

<p>If Rahu occupies the 9<sup>th</sup>, or the 10<sup>th</sup>,
the native will die at 16, though Indra, Lord of Lords, may try
to protect him.</p>

<p>Death will come to pass at the age of 20, if Saturn and the
Sun are in exchange R&#257;&#347;i.</p>

<p>If Rahu is in the Ascendant, while the Moon is in the
6<sup>th</sup> (or both of them being together in the
6<sup>th</sup>) will promote diseases in the rectum, indigestion
and deficiency of a limb.</p>

<p>Death will be caused due to leprosy, or tuberculosis, if the
Sun is in 8<sup>th</sup>, while Saturn is in 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>If the Sun is in the Ascendant at birth, the native will be
subjected to mental worries and will have no place of his
own.</p>

<p>The child will die instantly, if Rahu is in the Ascendant, or
in 8<sup>th</sup> and is in aspect to the Moon. Even Indra
cannot save such child.</p>

<p>The native will have a life-span of 100 years, if two Angles
are occupied by Jupiter and Venus, while the Sun is in
12<sup>th</sup> and Mercury is in Lagna.</p>

<p>There will be no Arishtas (evils), if Jupiter is in an Angle,
or in a Trine, or in own House/exaltation House, as the Lagna.
This will be so throughout the life.</p>

<p>There will be no evils whatsoever, if one of Jupiter, Venus
and Mercury is in an Angle and with positional strength.</p>

<p>There is no evil whatsoever, if Saturn happens to be in the
Ascendant, 3<sup>rd</sup>, or the 6<sup>th</sup> and be at the
same time in Libra, Aquarius, or Capricorn.</p>

<p>If the 2<sup>nd</sup> from the Ascendant is tenanted by Rahu,
Mercury, Venus, Saturn and the Sun together, the mother will die
soon. Alternatively it can be the father of the child.</p>

<p>if the Sun is in Leo, or in Aries identical with the
6<sup>th</sup>, or the 11<sup>th</sup> and is aspected by a
friendly planet, the evils, if any are simply counteracted.</p>

<p>Should Rahu be in the Ascendant identical with Aries, Taurus,
or Cancer and be in aspect to a benefic planet, no evil exists
in the horoscope.</p>

<p>RajaYoga is caused, if Saturn and the Moon are in the Lagna,
while its trines are occupied by the Sun and Jupiter. Mars
should be simultaneously in the 10<sup>th</sup> house.</p>

<p>Should the Sun be in the 9<sup>th</sup> in Leo, the native
will not have a surviving co-born. If however, one exists, he
becomes a king.</p>

<p>If Rahu is in Karma Sthana i.e. the 10<sup>th</sup> house,
identical with own house and in the company of Mars, Mercury and
Venus, the native will sometimes prosper and yet sometimes will
have downfall.</p>

<p>The subject is born in a mean descent, if malefics are in the
2<sup>nd</sup>, Rahu is in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and Jupiter is in
the 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>If the Sun etc. (i.e. other malefics) are in the
4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>, the native
will lose his first issue, while the later ones may survive.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in the 2<sup>nd</sup> along with Mars and
Saturn, while Rahu is in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, the co-born will
not survive.</p>

<p>Chatra Yoga is formed, if all planets are in the Ascendant,
2<sup>nd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>, he will
become a leader of his race.</p>

<p>If the Ascendant is occupied by Venus, 12<sup>th</sup> by
Mercury and the 2<sup>nd</sup> by a malefic, a RajaYoga is
formed and the native becomes a king.</p>

<p>If the Ascendant is occupied by Venus, 12<sup>th</sup> by
Mercury and the 2<sup>nd</sup> by a malefic, a RajaYoga is
formed and the native becomes a king. If the Sun is in the
12<sup>th</sup>, the subject will be subjected to penury.</p>

<p>The relatives of the native will perish, if the
12<sup>th</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> are occupied by malefics,
while the 2<sup>nd</sup> by benefics.</p>

<p>There is a RajaYoga, if the Moon and Saturn are in the
2<sup>nd</sup>, while Jupiter occupies Aries and Rahu with Venus
is in the 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and
12<sup>th</sup>, the native will lose his eyes in his
8<sup>th</sup>, or 12<sup>th</sup> year of age.</p>

<p>The co-born will not survive, if Mars is in the
8<sup>th</sup> house. Similar effects prevails, if he joins Rahu
and Saturn in the 7<sup>th</sup> house.</p>

<p>The results concerning Karma Sthana (i.e.  10<sup>th</sup>
house) will be meagerly felt, if Mars aspects the
10<sup>th</sup> house occupying Aries, or Scorpio, while Mercury
is associated with malefics.</p>

<p>The native will head many people, if Jupiter is in Leo, while
Venus is in virgo, Saturn is in Gemini and Mars in in the
4<sup>th</sup> identical with own house.</p>

<p>Should Saturn be in Virgo along with the Moon, while Mars is
in the sign Capricorn, Rahu in Aquarius and, Jupiter in Leo, the
native will destroy the band of his enemies. One born with such
planetary array will not be an ordinary man. He will advance his
family to a good state and enjoys RajaYoga.</p>

<p>The native will indulge in notorious acts at the age of 20
(i.e. from his 20<sup>th</sup> year), if Venus is in
Sagittarius, the Sun in Aquarius and Mars in Pisces
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Should a malefic be in the 11<sup>th</sup> house, while the
5<sup>th</sup> is occupied by Venus and the Moon, the native’s
first issue will be a female and such female’s mothers will be
subjected to many troubles.</p>

<p>There will be destruction of relatives, if the 4<sup>th</sup>
is occupied by Rahu, the 2<sup>nd</sup> by Jupiter and the
6<sup>th</sup>, or the 9<sup>th</sup> by Mercury.</p>

<p>Should the 9<sup>th</sup> be occupied by Jupiter, Mercury,
Venus and the Moon, the subject acquires success in all his
undertakings and will be honoured by a king.</p>

<p>If both malefics and benefics occupy severally the
6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>
and the 12<sup>th</sup>, the native will be honoured by the
king. But he will face many hardships in life.</p>

<p>If the 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and
9<sup>th</sup> are occupied by, respectively, Mars, Rahu, Venus
and the Sun, the native will protect his own people.</p>

<p>If the Ascendant is occupied by Saturn and the Moon, while
Venus is posited in the 8<sup>th</sup>, the subject will be
highly libidinous. Though he will be honoured by a King, he can
not enjoy any kind of happiness.</p>

<p>If the Moon is in Capricorn at birth along with debilitated
Jupiter, or with an inimical planet and aspected by Saturn, the
native will be a source of evil to his own co-born.</p>

 Leo and Jupiter in Scorpio, the native will be equal to a
king.</p>

<p>If at birth Saturn occupies Aquarius, Mars Capricorn and the
Moon Aries, while the 2<sup>nd</sup> house is occupied by the
Sun, the subject will enjoy paternal wealth, or his own
wealth.</p>

<p>If Mercury and the Sun occupy the 10<sup>th</sup>, while Rahu
is in the 6<sup>th</sup>, the native will lord over many.</p>

<p>If the Sun is in the 10<sup>th</sup> in Leo, or Saturn in
Libra identical with the 6<sup>th</sup>, or the Moon and Mercury
in the 9<sup>th</sup> in Gemini, a RajaYoga is formed.</p>

<p>Jupiter in Lagna, while Venus is in the 12<sup>th</sup>
holding the other planets in between indicates RajaYoga, this is
to the advantage of the native’s family to become strong (in all
respects).</p>

<p>The native doubtlessly becomes a king, if Jupiter is in the
8<sup>th</sup> and Venus is in the 3<sup>rd</sup>. All others
should be between them.</p>

<p>One born in Libra Lagna with exalted Saturn, while Jupiter is
in Taurus, the Moon in Gemini, Mars in Capricorn, Venus in Leo
and Mercury in Virgo along with the Sun, will have RajaYoga; he
will maintain justice, good deeds and auspiciousness in his
life. He will however cause Balarishta in the 8<sup>th</sup>, or
the 12<sup>th</sup> year.  The native will, however, later on
prove inauspicious for the elder brother, or sister.</p>

<p>If Libra happens to be the 2<sup>nd</sup> house, or an angle
and is occupied by a malefic, the native only faces sheer
poverty. He will not prove a good augury for his own people.</p>

<p>Should the Moon be in the 10<sup>th</sup>, while Venus is in
the 7<sup>th</sup> and malefics in the 4<sup>th</sup>, the
native’s dynasty ends with him and there will be no further
descent in his race.</p>

<p>The mother of the native will not survive, if Saturn is in
the 2<sup>nd</sup>, Rahu in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and Jupiter is in
Pisces.</p>

<p>Should Mars be in the 7<sup>th</sup>, while Venus is in the
8<sup>th</sup> followed by the Sun in the 9<sup>th</sup>, the
native will be shortlived.</p>

<p>If Jupiter is in the Ascendant, while Mars is not in the
7<sup>th</sup> and Venus is not in the 8<sup>th</sup> and the
Sun is not in the 9<sup>th</sup> an auspicious Yoga is caused.
Such a native will live a long lease of life, will have many
co-borns, will head many people (i.e.  employ many and feed
them), will be happy, will lead himself and his co-born to a
prosperous level, be free from proud conduct and be pleased in
all aspects of life.</p>

<p>If Saturn is in Cancer, while Rahu is in Taurus, the native
will be very liberal, will enjoy numerous Yogas, i.e. will reach
a very high state in life, will be famous, will be chief in his
race and will marry many women. If, however, the said Saturn is
lonely and aspects the 5<sup>th</sup>, there is only one
marriage.</p>

<p>The native will meet with his end, if Jupiter and Rahu are
together in the Ascendant, or the 4<sup>th</sup>. The end will
be in the 13<sup>th</sup> year even, if Lord Siva may try to
save him.  (That is, death in 13<sup>th</sup> year is
certain).</p>

<p>If Mars occupies the 8<sup>th</sup>, while the Sun is in fall
in the 5<sup>th</sup>, or the 9<sup>th</sup> and Jupiter must be
in accelerated motion. The native is blessed by Lakshmi, the
Goddess of Wealth.</p>

<p>Should Venus be in Pisces along with Mercury, while the
Ascendant, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> are, respectively,
tenanted by the Sun, Moon and Mars, a Raja Yoga is constituted.
One born under this kind of planetary array will respect Gods
and preceptors.  He will achieve such fame in his own native
country and abroad as well, that cannot be achieved by
others.</p>

<p>It the 12<sup>th</sup> is occupied by Jupiter, while the
2<sup>nd</sup> house has Saturn, Sun, Mars and Mercury, the
father of the native will pass away at the time of marriage of
the native.</p>

<p>If Jupiter is in the 3<sup>rd</sup>, while the planet Venus
is in the 11<sup>th</sup> the native will be famous among his
relatives and will shine, like a lamp among the men of his
race.</p>

<p>If Venus in the Ascendant is unaspected by anyone, while the
Moon is in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and Jupiter is in the
3<sup>rd</sup>, the native cannot enjoy any paternal
earnings.</p>

<p>Should Mars and Saturn be in Leo, while Venus is in Virgo and
Rahu is in Gemini, the child will lose its mother (early).</p>

<p>Should Mars and Saturn be in Leo, while Venus is in Virgo and
Rahu is in Gemini, this will cause poverty in childhood and
happiness in the later part, if the Moon join Mars.</p>

<p>If Lagna happens to be a malefic sign and is occupied by the
said malefic Lagna Lord himself, while one among the
4<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup> and the 10<sup>th</sup> being a
malefic sign is occupied by its own malefic lord, the child will
live only upto six. He will prove inauspicious to its mother.
Additionally, there will be destruction of maternal relatives,
if the 6<sup>th</sup> house is unaspected by Jupiter.</p>

<p>The child, who has the Sun in Leo, a malefic in Virgo and
Rahu in a malefic’s house will only live for six years.</p>

<p>The longevity is only for 19 years, if the Moon is in the
8<sup>th</sup>, malefics in angles and Rahu in the
10<sup>th</sup> at birth.</p>

<p>If a benefic planet is exalted in an angle, the native will
acquire a large kingdom and will protect his family.</p>

<p>Death of the father is imminent, if a child is born with Rahu
in the Ascendant and the Sun in the 7<sup>th</sup>, while Mars
is between Lagna and the 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p>A child, who has malefics posited in the 7<sup>th</sup>,
12<sup>th</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>, will always
have an ailing physique.</p>

<p>Should malefics be in the Lagna, 12<sup>th</sup> and
8<sup>th</sup> simultaneously, the child will be deprived of its
mother instantly, while its father will leave this world in its
4<sup>th</sup>, or 10<sup>th</sup> year of age.</p>
