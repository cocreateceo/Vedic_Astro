<h2><a name=1>CHAPTER I<br>
The Importance of Muhurtha</a></h2>

<p> The value of Time is inestimable. All objects in nature are
produced in Time, developed in Time and destroyed in Time. The
truth of these statements requires no further proof. It stands
unchallenged. Here we have a grand problem for solution. If the
creative, protective and destructive forces are embedded in the
all-Powerful Time recognised as the great KALAPURUSHA in the
astrological literature, then will it not be reasonable to study
the influences of the various energies issued from the solar
globe and from the other globes dependent upon the Sun for their
supply of all vital energies and reflected by them under various
modifications? Astrology is a science which deals with Time
proceeding from the Sun and all the wonderful phenomena which
are embodied in that mysterious agency. Scientific
investigations have now led to the conclusion that "we are faced
with a cosmic determinism". Astrology "is a complete system of
philosophy that requires the assistance of neither metaphysics
nor physics. It's the empirical systematisation of the idea that
radiation is the determinant of all terrestrial phenomena. That
idea is as valid today as when it was first started and the most
striking experimental evidence of its validity has been
furnished by modern scientific research. Being the first human
attempt to apply mathematics to biology its conclusions and
broad generalisations are being confirmed by newer scientific
data".

<p> As to how planets influence human beings, we do not propose to
answer in these pages. This particular subject has been dealt
with in detail in An Introduction to Study of Astrology by Prof.
B. Suryanarain Rao and in our Planetary Influences on Human
Affairs to which the reader may conveniently refer if he wishes
to understand the rationale of astrology. Suffice it to say that
we are living in a veritable sea of vibratory energies which
unerringly and equitably supply the means of creating,
maintaining and destroying life and its activities in our little
universe. Planetary x-rays are unseen vibrations and they affect
biological an.i psychological processes


<p> If we admit that the Sun is the source of all life and its
activities then it follows that in Time - which is denoted by
the Sun - is embedded all forces or energies for the works of
creation, protection and destruction and these energies have
been very carefully unearthed by the ancient Maharshis and
embodied into the formulae found so profusely in the pages of
MUHURTHA, an important division of astrology. Time is the
essence of all things - their creator, protector and destroyer.
The seasons of natural law into which the common year is divided
have their counterparts in the processional cycle of the Sun.
Periods of planting, cultivation, harvest, maturity and decay
are common to every subcycle of its activity. Time has got its
own properties. The first substance of Time is of course energy
generated by sidereal activity. Its forms are active when
phenomenal and potential when non-phenomenal. Time therefore can
be said to be the basic working power in astrology. This is
especially so in Muhurtha as within the time chosen for a
particular purpose all the good vibrations have to be centered
such that the energy generated would nullify all other
unfavourable factors and ensure success, of the enterprise.

<p> What is meant by Muhurtha? How far is it superior to horoscopy?
These are important questions which we shall try to answer in
this chapter. Horoscopy reads what is indicated by the planetary
positions at the time of birth being the resultant of one's
previous karma. In other words, it has to do only with what one
has brought with him the sum-total of one's inheritance -
physical, mental and material. Here we do nothing more than read
simply a technical letter as if it were written in planetary and
other symbols. Muhurtha, on the other hand, is much more
important. It gives valuable directions by following which the
person will be enabled to remove, neutralise, counteract or
overcome the evils indicated by the horoscopic chart. Horoscopy
is diagnostic. It merely points out the ills but prescribes no
remedies. Muhurtha is prescriptive as well as preventive. It
tells how by undertaking ventures at auspicious times one can
ward off the evils and ensure success. Suppose break in
education is indicated by the position of evil planets in the
fourth house from the Ascendant and by the affliction of
Jupiter, lord of education and Mercury, lord of intelligence.
These planetary conjunctions indicate want of education in a man
as a result of his karma in previous states of existence.
Muhurtha says that the obstructions to educational progress by
the planetary conjunctions indicated at the time of birth can be
minimised by fixing an auspicious time* for commencing the
education. Suppose evil planets in the fifth house indicate loss
of children. Then Muhurtha comes to his help first by asking him
to marry at a certain auspicious time when ethereal currents
released from the planets will be so powerful as to minimise or
modify the afflictions to the extent that the birth and survival
of at least some children may be ensured. Thus Muhurtha helps
one to minimise or modify the evils of our past Karma to a
considerable extent. I must warn my readers not to imagine that
Muhurtha is the masterkey to all wealth and happiness. Muhurtha
tells us when to do a certain thing if failure is to be avoided.

<p> We have said above that creative, protective and destructive
forces are embedded in the womb of Time. As the Sun and the
planets are the signatures of time and as all the forces or
energies have their source of origin in the Sun, the movements
of planets give us a clue as to when the various kinds of
creative and destructive forces which are nothing but radiations
set in.

<p> Taking an everyday example: nobody could say that the influence
of the Sun during the course of one day will be the same. The
Sun in the morning, the Sun in the afternoon, the Sun in the
evening and the Sun at midnight cannot and will not be the same
in heat or in any of his other agencies-light, magnetism,
electricity, etc. A man wants to have a picnic and we ask him to
have it either in the morning or in the evening when the Sun is
not very hot. This will be asking him to reject the noon as
inauspicious for pleasure. Here the physical effects are
demonstrable to some extent. Similarly a man wants to have a
pleasant function. We advise him to have it at a suitable lime
when, in spite of the season being rainy, there is no chance of
the weather being cloudy or rainy. Will we be wrong in asking
him to reject the time when the weather is likely to be
disturbed? The same reasoning should guide us to appreciate the
idea behind the selection of auspicious times for our various
activities. There is a time to sow and a time to reap. Why not
we do the sowing operations during harvest season? Nature would
be against us. This is shown by the Sun's position. During the
sowing season, creative forces are in operation. When an
important activity is to be undertaken, destructive forces have
to be screened off. All the planets move incessantly and release
different kinds of forces and the Maharshis have given us clues
as to how best we can make use of the grand constructive
vibrations operating in nature if our endeavours are to be
endowed with success.

<p> Even animals instinctively feel that they should move in
harmony with nature. For instance, the palolo worm found in the
sea around the Fiji Islands reacts in a very definite way to
lunar and solar cycles. This animal lives the greater part of
its life in deep coral rocks beneath the sea. Towards November,
the hind portion of the body becomes distended with migrate
eggs. In the early morning, exactly one week after the full moon
in November, the hind portion detaches itself as a special
reproductive individual which comes to the surface, discharges
its eggs in an explosive manner and then dies. There is
therefore some sort of an instinctive appreciation on the part
of the worm of the Moon's influences, and that the eggs should
be discharged only when the planetary vibrations are
harmoniously disposed. When such is the case, a human being is
to be much more conscious about forces that make or mar his
progress and how by the selection of a proper moment, he could
take advantage of the constructive forces operating in nature.

<p> Each moment has got its own potency and as Carl Jung says
"whatever is born or done this moment of time has the qualities
of this moment of time". Hence the moment of birth or the moment
at which we elect to do an important act is not certainly an
insignificant epoch. Cosmic radiations pouring at the moment on
the earth from outer space and coming from various stars and
planets act on our brain cells which take up these cosmic
radiations which are transformed into vital electricity. It must
be noted that in all undertakings invisible energies are set in
motion by ourwords, deeds, thoughts and of course by our
actions. You may call these invisible forces as electric,
ethereal or electro-magnetic or cosmic radiations. As man
himself is an electrical body discharging different kinds of
electrical energies, his success and failure are simply matters
of attraction and repulsion between himself and the objects
with which he has to deal in his day-to-day activities.

<p> Muhurtha could therefore be defined as that precious moment
when the vibrations radiated by man are altered to a specific
wavelength capable of entering resonance with the radiations of
the same vibratory rate coming from other planets and stars.


<h2><a name=2>CHAPTER II<br>
General Hints</a></h2>

<p> A very important place is assigned in Hindu astrology to the
part played by the Moon in the fixing of propitious times. The
Moon rules the mind and all our psychological inhibitions and
his position in the election chart is t0 be particularly
dignified. Moreover, whenever an election is to be made, it
should always bear a sympathetic connection with the birth
chart. Should the radical horoscope indicate several
afflictions, no Muhurtha can ensure real success. In fact, the
strength of the birth chart may even prevent the person from
taking advantage of the propitious period. Or at best, the
chances of failure may be somewhat minimised. There is,
therefore, an important factor to be considered, viz., whether
the birth chart is really so powerfully afflicted as to offset
the chances of success shown in the election chart. When people
do not know the birth chart, the best thing would be to
ascertain their name constellation (see Appendix at the end of
the book) and study the transit influences operating at the
period in question. Whether or not the radical chart is strong,
Hindu astrology always takes cognisance of the fact that contact
is maintained between the Jamma Tara (the constellational
position of the Moon at the time of one's birth) and if the
birth time is not known, with the Nama Tara
(name-constellation), and the election chart.

<p> Whilst it is necessary to bear in mind that the election chart
is likely to be affected by the benefic or malefic nature of the
directions operating at the moment in the birth chart and the
inherent strength of the horoscope, it is not necessary to go
into it in detail. A number of combinations is given in ancient
works to so strengthen the election chart as to make it fruitful
independent of the birth influences. These details will be
discussed in their appropriate places.

<p> Before we take up electional astrology proper, a short
description of the Panchanga or the Hindu almanac is very
necessary, as the important items constituting a Panchanga have
an intimate bearing on the fixing of auspicious times. The
Panchanga consists of five limbs or accessories, viz: Tithi
(lunar day), Vara (weekday), Nakshatra (constellation). Yoga (a
luni-solar day), and Karana (half a lunar day). The reader will
have to be familiar with these technicalities though by far the
most mportant ones are the lunar day, constellation and weekday.
The five limbs of the Panchanga are supposed to represent the
five sources of ethereal energy of which some are visible and
others invisible and which when properly secured are said to
conduce the health, wealth and prosperity of mankind.

<p> Tithi. - This is the time during which the difference of the
increment of longitude of the Sun and the Moon amounts to 12&deg;.
The lunar day is to the Hindu of the most prominent practical
importance, since by it are regulated the performance of many
religious ceremonies and upon it depend the chief considerations
of Muhurtha or electional astrology. In other words, the tithi
represents the lunar energy, and lunar energy is identified with
mental energy. Therefore a minute knowledge of the lunar
movements constituting tithis is said to give us wealth.

<p> Each tithi (See Table II) or lunar day is equal to 0.9483 of a
day so that a lunar month is equal to about 29.53 days. The
ending time of a tithi is the moment at which the Moon is
removed from the Sun by multiples of 12&deg;. Thus when the Moon is
12&deg; away from the Sun, the first lunar day or Prathama ends;
when 24&deg; Dwrtiya and so on; when in conjunction the Amavasya
{New Moon), and when in opposition (180&deg;) Pournimasya (full
Moon)ends.

<p> It is enough for astrological purposes to know what tithi rules
at the time of birth.

<p> To find the lunar day or tithi deduct the longitude of the Sun
from that of the Moon. If the difference is less than 180&deg;, it
is the bright half or Sukia Paksha; if it is more than 180&deg;, it
is the dark half or Krishna Paksha.

<p> Divide the balance (Moon-Sun) by 12&deg;(or 720'). The quotient
represents the number of tithis elapsed and the remainder the
part of the next (current) tithi that has elapsed.

<p> Thus to know the tithi ruling on 8-8-1896 at 4h 10m 20s
(L.M.T.) at Bangalore. First we deduct the longitude of the Sun
(114&deg; 40' or 6880') from that of the Moon (326&deg; or 19560'). The
remainder is 211&deg;20' (12680'). It is more than 180&deg; and hence it
is the dark half (Krishna Paksha). Dividing by 12&deg; (or 720') the
quotient is 17, which means the lunar day is the 18th (or 3rd
lunar day of the dark half). 440' (7&deg; 20') of its portion has
been traversed, leaving 280' (4&deg; 40') yet to be traversed. If
this remainder is multiplied by 24 and divided by the difference
of the daily motions of the Sun and the Moon, we get the number
of hours (from. the time of birth or question) still covering
the tithi in question.

<pre>
Suppose the daily motion of the Moon on the day
           of birth is                   11&deg; 47'
            *Daily motion of the Sun         57'
                                         -------
                                         10&deg; 50'
                 Difference:           =    650'
</pre>

<hr>
<p>* For convenience sake more than 30" are taken as 1' and less
then 30" rejected.
<hr>

<p>Multiplying 280 by 24 and dividing the product by 660 we get
<pre>
           280 x 24
           --------  = 10h. 57m.
             650
</pre>
<p>which added to the given time gives 3h. 27m. = 3h. a.m.
(on 9th August) which will be the ending moment of
the tithi (3rd lunar day of the dark half).


<p> Vara. - This is of course the ordinary weekday. The weekdays
are named in accordance with certain astronomical
considerations. Therefore on a weekday bearing the name of a
particular planet, the influence of that planet is said to be
predominant.

<p> The weekdays are numbered thus: Sunday 1. Monday 2, Tuesday 3,
Wednesday 4. Thursday 5, Friday 6 and Saturday 7.

<p> Wakshatra. - The zodiac is marked by 27 constellations or
nakshatras often termed lunar mansions. The position of a
nakshatra is dependent upon the actual time taken by the Moon to
traverse 13&deg; 20' of ecliptic arc, of course, always beginning
from the first point of the constellational zodiac. If
constellations are huge electromagnetic bodies radiating energy
into space, there seems to be sense in attributing certain
influences to these radiations and the Moon coming into contact
with such radiations probably exercises special influences. The
Janma Tara (birth constellation) or Dina Tara (the constellation
of the day concerned) is obtained thus:


<p> The ecliptic is divided into 27 constellations (See Appendix
III) of 13&deg; 20' (or 800' of arc) each. Reduce the longitude of
the Moon to minutes and divide the same by 800. The quotient is
the number of constellations already passed, and the remainder,
the part covered in the current asterism the Moon is in. For the
data given under tithi.

<pre>
The Moon is in Aquarius   25&deg; 59' 46"
                        = 10 signs 25&deg; 59' 46"
                        = 325&deg; 59' 46"
                        = 19559' 46"

Dividing this by 800

                        =  Quotient 24
                           remainder 359' 46"
</pre>

<p> The ruling star is the 25th, viz., Poorvabhadra. 359' 46" have
been covered in this star and the balance to be traversed is
(800' - 359' 46").

<p> Yoga. - it is the period during which the joint motion in
longitude of the Sun and the Moon amounts to 13&deg; 20'. Every
Hindu almanac contains a column specifying the yoga for each day
and when it would end.  There are twenty-seven yogas (see
Appendix IV).

<p> Yoga represents a conjunction of subtle influences which
strengthen our bodies, remove the germs of disease, and help us
to enjoy health and life in its various phases.


<pre>
                       YOGA

  The following formula is according to Surya siddhanta:

  Sun's longitude + Moon's longitude
  ----------------------------------
          13" 20'(or 800')

  Taking the example date given under tithi:
            Sun's longitude          114&deg; 40'
            Moon's longitude         326&deg;  0'
                                     --------
                       Total         440&deg; 40'
                                 =    80&deg; 40'
                                 =      4840'
</pre>

<p>Dividing 4840' by 800 we get quotient 6 and remainder 40. 6
Yogas have transpired and the 7th, viz, Sukarman is ruling. 40'
is the part of the current (Sukarman) that has elapsed. Yet to
be covered  in this Yoga is 760'.  To ascertain the time at
which the current Yoga ends, divide 760' by the sum of the daily
motions of the Sun and the Moon (0&deg;57' + 11&deg; 47' s 12&deg; 44' or
764') and multiply by 24 to reduce the results to hours.

<pre>
                      760 x 24
                      --------  = 23h. 50m.
                        764
</pre>

<p>The Sukarman Yoga ends at 23h. 50m. from the time of birth or
any given time.


<p> The Table of Yogas (Appendix IV) enables one to ascertain the
Yoga on the basis of the joint motion of the Sun and the Moon.


<p> Thus in the example the sum of the Sun's and the Moon's
longitude is 80&deg; 40'. According to Appendix IV Sukarman
commences at 80&deg; and extends tilt 93&deg; 20'.

<p> Karana. - And finally we have karana, or half a lunar day
meaning thereby the time taken to complete the distance which
should be the multiple of 6 between the Sun and the Moon. There
are 11 karanas, viz. (1) Bava, (2) Balava, (3) Kaulava, (4)
Taitula, (5) Garija, (6) Vanija, (7) Visti, (8) Sakuna, (9)
Chatushpada, (10) Naga and (11) Kimstughna. The first seven come
by rotation eight times in a lunar month, commencing with the
second half of the first lunar day. The last four are said to be
permanent karanas and occur in order with the second half of the
29th lunar day.

<p> In Muhurtha, it is always advisable to strengthen the ascendant
and its lord and the Moon. Each type of election requires
fortification of some appropriate hoase and planet and these
will be discussed in their proper places. Even when the
ascendant is strong, certain parts of it which go under the name
of Lagna tyajya should be rejected. Sometimes, only fixed signs
are to be chosen; sometimes only movable signs are to be chosen.
Hence, a reader has to very carefully understand these subtle
distinctions.

<p> In Aries, Taurus, Sagittarius and Virgo, the first three
degrees should be avoided as it is supposed to be in the nature
of a serpent (bhujanga) and hence destructive. In regard to
Pisces, Capricorn, Cancer and Scorpio, the last (three degrees)
has to be avoided as it is supposed to be presided over by the
evil force of Rahu. The middle half ghati (13&deg; 30' to 16&deg; 30')
should be rejected with regard to Gemini, Libra, Leo and
Aquarius as it is ruled by an evil force termed Gridhra.

<p> Tuesday and Saturday should be avoided for all good
and-auspicious works.

<p> The 4th, 8th, *12th and 14th lunar days both.in the bright and
the dark halves are unsuitable for undertaking any auspicious
work.

<hr>
<p>* In our experience, the 12th lunar day is quite auspicious;
provided the other factors are strong, 12th lunar day can be
employed for auspicious works.
<hr>

<p> Each constellation has its own tyajyakala or negative period
which is to be invariably avoided. The negative periods commence
at the times marked below against each constellation lasting for
4 ghatis (1 hour 36 minutes) from thence.

<p> Aswini 50; Bharani 4; Krittika 30; Rohini 40; Mrigasira 14;
Aridra 21; Punarvasu 30; Pushya 20; Aslesha 32; Makha 30; Pubba
20; Uttara 1; Hasta 21; Chitta 20; Swati 14; Visakha 14;
Anuradha 10; Jyeshta 14; Moola 20; Poorvashadha 20; Uttarashadha
20; Sravana 10; Dhanishta 10; Satabhisha 18; Poorvabhadra 16;
Uttarabhadra and Revati 30.

<p> In the scheme that is followed, I have first of all dealt with
the pre-natal and post-natal ceremonies which are designated as
Shodasa Karmas which every Hindu is supposed to undergo in his
life's journey from cradle to the grave. Some of these
ceremonies such as baptising, first feeding, marriage, etc., are
common to all communities so that non-Hindus can make use of
them with equal benefit.


<p> The Shodasa Karmas (sixteen kinds of ceremonies), which a Hindu
is enjoined to undergo, seem to have been based upon certain
critical psychological and physiological developments
(climacterics) which occur in a man's life at certain definite
intervals. It must be noted that the successive stage when the
human infant assumes the upright posture, commences to speak and
so on, occur at fixed times in normal development so much so
that a child that does not begin to talk or walk at the proper
time becomes a source of anxiety to his parents. The change of
teeth also marks a transition. Permanent dentition sets in
about 7 years after birth. Seven years after this another
crisis is reached and that is puberty. A further change is noted
about the age of
21. There are of course several other critical periods such as
the menopause occurring at the age of 49 or 50 (7*7), another
grand climacteric at 63 (7*9) often accompanied by death. In the
human being, it is said that every cell of the body is renewed
every seven years, although this is not quite correct for all
tissues. Thus, the Shodasa Karmas are supposed to fortify the.
human body and human mind at such critical phases. Perhaps a
deeper study of the problem will reveal a more correct
perspective of the rationale.


<h2><a name=3>CHAPTER III<br>
The Birth Star and the Birth Moon</a></h2>

<p> In fixing auspicious times, apart from the special planetary
combinations to be applied for specific purposes, there are
three factors which are common to almost all elections and which
require the astrologer's most careful attention. They are (a)
Tarabala or strength of constellation, (b) Chandrabala or lunar
strength, and (c) Panchaka or five-source energy. These three
should be satisfactorily disposed. Otherwise an election chart
will lose its significance.

<p> Strength of Constellation. - The constellation ruling at the
time of birth is one's Janmanakshatra or birth star and the
zodiacal sign in which the Moon is situated at the time of one's
birth is one's Janma Rasi or Birth Moon. These are highly
important. Count from the birth constellation to the one ruling
on the particular day on which a new work is to be done or a
journey undertaken and divide the number by 9 if divisible.
Otherwise keep it as it is. If the remainder is 1 (janma) it
indicates danger to body; if 2 (sampat) wealth and prosperity;
if 3 (vipat) dangers, losses and accidents; if 4 (kshema)
prosperity; if 5 (pratyak) obstacles; if 6 (sadhana) realisation
of ambitions; if 7 (naidhana) dangers; if 8 (mitra) good; and if
9 (parama mitra) very favourable. There are certain exceptions
to the favourable and unfavourable results ascribed above and
they will be dealt with in the appropriate places.

<p> Example: - A man born in Aswini elects to undertake a journey
on a day ruled by Sravana. Counting from the man's Janma
Nakshatra to the one ruling on the proposed day. the number will
be 22. This divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 4. This goes
under kshema or favourable and hence Tarabala is good.

<p> When the day's nakshatra falls in the first Paryaya or cycle,
that is-within the first nine stars, the evil suggested above,
viz. 3rd star Vipat. 5th star Pratyak. etc., holds good in
full.

<p> In the Second Paryaya or cycle, e.g. Janma Nakshatra, etc.,
falling from the 10th to 18th, the evil is said to be only fifty
per cent. In fact the evil is centred only in the first quarter
of the 3rd (Vipat), the 4th quarter of the 5th (Pratyak) and the
3rd quarter of the 7th (Naidhana) of the second cycle.

<p> In the third cycle or Paryaya, the Janma, Vipat, etc., falling
from the 19th to 27th the evil is said to be almost negligible.
Suppose the birth star is Rohini and the day's star is
Satabhisha. The day's star counted from birth star comes to 21.
or the 3rd in the third cycle. The 3rd is Vipat. But it is said
to carry little or no evil.

<p> In my humble experience, it is better to avoid Vipat and
Naidhana stars for all important undertakings - long journeys,
marriage, starting of an enterprise, etc., even if such a star
happens to fall in the 3rd-cycle, unless there are other
counteracting factors.

<p> According to some classical writers, the 22nd and 27th stars
are always inauspicious. But our experience is to the contrary.
The 22nd is always sadhana and the 27th parama mftra and hence
they could be considered as auspicious.

<p> Chandrabala. - As we have already said above, the consideration
of the Moon and his position are of much importance in Muhurtha.
To be at its best, the Moon should not occupy in the election
chart, a position that happens to represent the 6th, 8th or 12th
from the person's Janma Rasi.

<p> To take another example: a person born in Mrigasira (Janma Rasi
being Taurus) wants to have his marriage on a day ruled by
Bharani which means the Moon will be in Aries. There is neither
Tarabala (as Bharani will be Naidhana to Mrigasira) nor
Chandrabala (the Moon on the election day falls in Aries which
would be the 12th from the subject's Janma Rasi). Hence, the day
is most inauspicious. Certain constellations, apart from their
being harmonious or otherwise disposed with reference to one's
own Janma Nakshatra, should be avoided for certain specific
purposes on account of their inherent evil natures. In fact,
Bharani is condemned for all good work and it has to be
scrupulously avoided for all good work.


<p> Panchaka (Five-Source Energy). - For matters of ordinary
importance such as interviewing superiors or going on short
journeys, a favourable Tarabala will do and there is no need to
consider the panchaka. But in regard to very important
ceremonies such as marriage, nuptials, entry into new houses,
etc., this should be carefully looked into. There are several
methods by which panchaka is determined. I shall give the most
common method. In the panchaka determination apparently, five
sources of planetary, stellar and zodiacal energies are
involved. Take the number of the lunar day (from the 1st of the
month), the number of the weekday, Sunday I. etc.), the number
of the constellation (from Aswini) and the number of the Lagna
(from Aries). Add these together and divide the total by 9. If
the remainder is 1 (mrityu panchakam), it indicates danger; if 2
(agni panchakam), risk from fire; if 4 (raja panchakam), bad
results; if 6 (chora panchakam), evil happenings and if 8 (roga
panchakam), disease. If the remainder is 3, 5, 7 or zero then it
is good. As an example, let us assume that A wants to start a
business on a day and time otherwise conforming to the
requirement of Muhurtha-the constellation being Aslesha, the
lunar day being the 13th, the rising sign being Virgo and the
weekday Sunday. Calculating the panchaka, we get -

<pre>
        Number of the lunar day       13
        Number of constellation        9
        Number of weekday              1
        Number of zodiacal sign        6
				      --
                                      29
</pre>

<p>Dividing this by 9, we get 29/9 = 3 2/9 - 2 as remainder. It
indicates Vahni or fire and hence the time selected is not
favourable. In dealing with this subject. Prof. B. Suryanarain
Rao observes thus in bis famous book ASTROLOGICAL MIRROR: "There
are many things as in medicine, so in astrology which when
properly understood and followed would tend to minimise the
chances of evil influences indicated by planets, lunar days,
constellations and rising signs and in all these the idea seems
to be to avert the evils which would arise as a matter of fact
from the attraction or combination ot the subtle influences
contained in Time and the chemical changes which arise from the
conjunctions and repulsions of various forms of energies, some
of which are visible, while many of which ars subtle and very
mysterious in their nature."

<p> The general rule of avoiding unfavourable panchaka has certain
exceptions. When an election is to do with occupation, avoid
Raja Panchaka. In elections bearing on house building avoid both
Raja and Agni Panchakas. In regard to travel, Chora Panchaka
should be rejected. In marriage and upanayanam, Roga and Mrityu
Panchakas should be avoided. Conversely it also means that a
panchaka declared unsuitable for a particular type of election
could be used for a different kind of election. No astrological
authority has specifically approved this step but by
implication, we can assume that there is no objection if, for
instance, we ignore raja panchaka for travelling or marriage or
roga panchaka for house-building. As far as possible, it is
advisable to avoid the evil of panchaka in general irrespective
of its definite bearing on an election. But when a more
auspicious day cannot be secured, we can resort to the lesser of
the two evils.

<p> As regards Tarabala referred to above, it is no doubt advisable
to avoid a day that is ruled by the 1st, 3rd; 5th and 7th
constellations. But when the day is otherwise favourable, only
the negative parts of these unfavourable constellations may be
avoided. Thus, in the Janma, Vipat, Pratyak and Naidhana
constellations, the first 7, 3, 8 and 6 ghatis respectively may
be considered evil and avoided. Thus, a man whose Janma
Nakshatra is Pushyami can undertake a venture on a day ruled by
Makha (Vipat) provided he avoids the first seven ghatis of the
constellation. The stigma attached to the star being Vipat no
longer holds good. Generally these exceptions are resorted to
only under special circumstances when an election is to be
urgently made and when the undertaking admits of no delay.

<p> A day ruled by one's Janma Nakshatra is ordinarily held to be
unfavourable for an election. But in regard to nuptials,
sacrifices, first feeding, agriculture, upanayanam, coronation,
buying lands, learning the alphabet, Janma Nakshatra is
favourable without exception. But it is inauspicious for war,
sexual union, shaving, taking medical treatment, travel and
marriage. For a woman, Janma Nakshatra would be quite
favourable for marriage.

<p> There are several technicalities to be considered in the
selection of auspicious times and in spite of the apparent
inconsistencies to be found in the opinions expressed by
different classical writers on this subject, I have endeavoured
to give the easiest and what, in my humble opinion, are the most
reliable principles bearing on this all-important subject.


<h2><a name=4>CHAPTER IV<br>
Influence of Constellations</a></h2>

<p> The whole of Muhurtha or for that matter, the whole of Hindu
astrology is based on the movements of planets in relation to
the constellations. The wisdom of the ancient Indians in making
predictive astrology, dependent upon the fixed zodiac, is being
increasingly appreciated by students of the science. The
question of zodiacal influences hinges on the fact whether the
star-points or constellations with which the Sun comes into line
from day-to-day derive their influences from that body or
irrespective of the shifting position of the Sun, there is any
special virtue attaching to these star-points. We have shown
with incontrovertible evidence in several of our articles in THE
ASTROLOGICAL MAGAZINE that the stars have a decided influence on
all human affairs and we have several times disproved the absurd
views displayed by the so-called scientists that because stars
are removed millions and billions of miles away from us, there
cannot be any connection between those gigantic masses and the
living human beings. These electro-magnetic bodies are capable
of discharging different kinds of energies manifesting
themselves in different ways. When a constellation like Bharani
(beta Arietis) is held to be constitutionally unfit for certain
types of elections; it means that the vibrations emanating from
it are destructive in character.

<p> I do not propose to discuss here the astrological influences of
the various constellations elaborately. I would give just the
important ones, mainly based on BRIHAT SAMHITA and leave the
reader to refer to more standard works on Muhurtha for further
details.

<p> The 28 constellations (including Abhijit which is generally
ignored in everyday astrological consultations) are presided
over by Aswini. Yama, Agni. Prajapati, the Moon, Rudra, Aditi,
Jupiter, Serpent, Pitrus or manes, Bhaga, Aryaman, Savita,
Swashta, Vayu.lndragni, Mitra, Indra, Niruti, Visvedewa,
Brahman, Vishnu, Vasu, Varuna, Ajaikapat, Ahirbudhnya and Pushan
respectively.

<p> Rohini, Uttara, Uttarashadha and Uttarabhadra are supposed to
be fixed constellations and they are favourable for coronations,
laying the foundations of cities, sowing operations, planting
trees and other permanent things.

<p> Chitta, Anuradha, Mrigasira and Revati are soft constellations.
They are good for wearing new apparel, learning dancing, music
and fine arts, sexual union and performance of auspicious
ceremonies.

<p> Aswini, Pushya, Hasta and Abhijit are light constellations, and
they can be selected for putting ornamentation, pleasures and
sports, administering medicine, starting industries and
undertaking travels.

<p> Moola, Jyestha, Aridra and Aslesha are sharp in nature and they
are favourable for incantations, invoking spirits, for
imprisonment, murders, and separation of friends.

<p> Saravana, Dhanishta, Satabhisha, Punarvasu and Swati are
movable stars and they are auspicious fcr acquiring vehicles,
for gardening and for going on procession.

<p> Pubba, Poorvashadha and Poorvabhadra, Bharani and Makha are
dreadful stars and they a re suitable for nefarious schemes,
poisoning, deceit, imprisonment, setting fire and other evil
deeds.

<p> Krittika and Visakha are mixed constellations and during their
influences, works of day-to-day importance can be undertaken.

<p> Beginning from the third quarter of Dhanishta and ending with
the last part of Revati, the time is held to be unsuitable for
any kind of auspicious work. This period goes under the special
name of Nakshatra Panchaka and when these stars are ruling, one
should avoid journey towards the south, house repairing or
renovation, collecting fuel and cattle fodder or acquiring cots
and beds.

<p> Of all the twenty-eight constellations, the pride of place
appears to have been given to Pushya, the 8th star.

<p> The constellation of Pushya is supposed to be the most
favourable of all the 28 constellations. It is said to
neutralise almost all doshas or flaws arising out of a number of
adverse combinations. The Rishis go to the extent of saying that
even if unfavourable combinations are present in the birth
horoscope hampering ones success in life, and the ruling
constellation and the position of the Moon are all adverse,
Pushya has the power of neutralising these evil forces and
asserting its benefic nature. In spite of all the benefic
influences attributed to Pushya, it is held to be inauspicious
for purposes of marriage. There may be an element of
exaggeration In the assertion that Pushya is capable of
modifying all the evil influences present in an election chart
but there is no doubt whatsoever that it is a constellation par
excellence that could be universally employed for all purposes,
excepting of course marriage.


<h2><a name=5>CHAPTER V<br>
Special Adverse Yogas and their Neutralisation</a></h2>

<p> The farmers of the astrological rules were not mere
theoreticians. They were practical men and did not beleive in
merely cataloguing their observations for academical purposes.
Whilst it is always desirable to fix a Muhurtha that is
auspicious by all standards of astrological rules, there would
sometimes be practical difficulties and emergent occasions which
admit of no delay. Therefore, emphasis is laid on what is called
gunabahulya or excess of good and dosha swalpa or deficiency of
evil. When one has to visit a friend or a relation, who is
seriously ill in, a far-off place, we are asked not to attach
any consideration to the astrological factors. Because at a
moment's notice it is impossible to get a time which could be
deemed to be propitious astrologically. But when one is to go on
a pilgrimage or a business tour or for a marriage, one should
see that he starts under influences that are harmoniously
disposed towards him.

<p> There are said to be 21 great evils (ekavimsati mahadoshas)
which are to be avoided for any auspicious work. But when one
finds it difficult to avoid them because of astrological
impossibility or circumstantial inability, one can take
advantage of the neutralising combinations which are generally
supposed to act as antidotes. We may just make a passing
reference to these 21 great evils for the information of the
readers. They are: -

<p> 1. Panchanga Suddhi. - We have already said that a Panchanga
consists of tithi, vara, nakshatra. yoga and karana. All these
must be auspicious. In regard to lunar days, the 4th, 6th, 8th,
12th and 14th, full and new moon days should be avoided. In
regard to vara, Thursday and Friday are held to be suitable for
all works. Tuesday, is to be generally avoided except when it
happens to be the 10th, 12th or 16th day of the child's birth
when the child's Namakarana (baptising or giving name) may be
performed. Of the several Nakshatras, Bharani and Krittika
should be avoided for all auspicious works as these two are said
to be presided over by the god of death (Yama) and the god of
fire (Agni) respectively. In urgent cases if the Lagna could be
fortified, the dosha due to nakshatra may get neutralised. The
last parts of Aslesha, Jyeshta and Revati should also be
avoided. Coming to the Yoga (vide page 12) the 6th (Atiganda).
9th (Soola). 10th (Ganda), 17th (Vyatipata) and 27th (Vydhruti)
have deleterious effects upon events which are started or
commenced under them. - The Karana chosen must be appropriate to
the election in view. Thus Bava is auspicious for starting works
of permanent importance while Thaithula is propitious for
marriage. Bhadra is unfit for any good work but is eminently
suitable for violent and cruel deeds. For getting initiation
into kshudra mantras Sakuni Havana is propitious.

<p> Therefore, Panchanga Suddhi means a good lunar day, a
beneficial weekday, an auspicious constellation, a good yoga and
a fertilising Karana.

<p> 2. Surya Sankramana. - The 2nd great evil is Surya Sankramana
or the solar ingress into different zodiacal signs. When the Sun
is about to leave one sign and enter another there seem to occur
certain disturbances in the organisation of the solar forces and
such times are not recommended for any good work. On the
contrary, they are held to be propitious for meditation,
initiation into secret mantras and performance of certain
religious rites which are held to purify not only the bodily
electrical discharges but also the mental currents. Sixteen
ghatis (6 hours 24 minutes) both before and after the entry of
the Sun into a new sign should be rejected for all new works.

<p> 3. Karthari Dosha. - Karthari means scissors. In an election,
when two evil planets are placed on either side of the Lagna,
the combination goes under the special name of Karthari Dosha
and it should be rejected for good work particularly in regard
to marriage.

<p> 4. Shashtashta Riphagatha Chandra Dosha. - The Moon should
invariably be avoided in the 6th, 8th and 12th houses from the
Lagna rising in an election chart.

<p> 5. Sagraha Chandra Dosha. - The Moon's association with any
other planet, benefic or malefic, should be avoided. This
injunction is specially applicable in case of marriage.

<p> 6. Udayasta Suddhi. - The Lagna and the seventh should be
strong. The Lagna should be occupied by its own lord and the
Navamsa Lagna by its own lord or vice versa or lord of Lagna
should aspect Navamsa Lagna and vice versa. Similarly the
seventh and the lord of the seventh Bhava should be favourably
disposed. The strength of Lagna and the seventh is necessary in
all elections but especially so in regard to marriage.

<p> 7. Durmuhurtha. - Muhurtha technically means 48 minutes or 2
ghatis in terms of time. A sidereal day consists of 30
muhurthas. The 1st fifteen diurnal muhurthas named are: (1)
Rudra. (2) Ahi. (3) Mitra,, (4) Pitrii, (5) Vasu, (6) Vara. (7)
Vishwedeva, (8) Vidhi, (9) Sathamukhi, (10) Puruhuta, (H)Vahini,
(12) Naktanchara, (13) Varuna, (14) Aryama and (15) Bhaga. The
nocturnal muhurthas are: (1) Girisa, (2) Ajipada, (3)
Ahirbudhnya. (4) Pusha, (5) Aswi, (6) Yama, (7) Agni. (8)
Vidhatru, (9) Chanda, (10) Aditi, (11) Jeeva, (12) Vishnu. (13)
Yumigadyuti, (14) Thyasthur and (15) Samdram.

<p> In regard to the diurnal muhurtha, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 10th,
11th, 12th and 15th are inauspicious while in nocturnai
muhurthas the 1st. 2nd, 6th and 7th are inauspicious.

<p> In calculating the muhurtha, the exact length of day and night
should be ascertained. Each muhurtha is said to last for 48
minutes (2 ghatis) on the assumption that the duration of day
and night is of equal proportion, viz. 30 ghatis, or 12 hours.
If the length of day is 28 ghatis, then each muhurtha extends
for 1 ghati and 52 vighatis (20h 20s. 8).

<p> Apart from the above general classification of good and bad
muhurthas, the following should also be deemed as unpropitious
on the different weekdays. Sunday coinciding with the 14th lunar
day (Aryama); Monday the 8th (Vidhi) and the 12th (Naktanchara);
Tuesday the 4th (Prtru) and the 11th (Vahni); Wednesday
(Abhijit); Thursday the 12th (Naktanchara) and 13th (Varuna);
Fflday'the 4th (Pitru) and the 8th (Vidhi) and Saturday the 1st
(Rudra) and the 2nd (Ahi).

<p> Particularly in marriages, the muhurthas declared above as
inauspicious in regard to weekdays should not be considered.

<p> 8. Gandanthara. - The last 2 ghatis (48 minutes) of the 5th,
10th and 15th (Full Moon) and the first 2 ghatis of the 6th,
11th and 1st (dark half) lunar days go under tithigandanthara
and they should be rejected for all new works. Similarly, the
last 2 degrees of Cancer. Scorpio and Pisces and the first 2
degrees of Leo, Sagittarius and Aries are inauspicious. The last
ghatis of Aslesha, Jyeshta, Moola, Revati and Aswini and the
first four ghatis of Makha should be avoided as injurious for
good work.

<p> Papashadvargs. - Malefics should not be strong in shadvargas in
an election chart.

<p> 10. Bhrigu Shatka. - The position of Venus in the 6th is
injurious. This is especially so in regard to marriage. Even
when Venus is exalted and associated with benefics, such a
disposition is not approved.

<p> 11. Kujasthama: - Mars should be avoided in the 8th house, as
it indicates destruction of the object in view. In a marriage
election chart. Mars in the 8th is unthinkable. Even if Mars is
otherwise powerful, he should not occupy the 8th house.

<p> 12. Ashtama Lagna Dosha. - In selecting a time for marriage,
the Lagna ascending should not happen to be the 8th from the
Janma Lagna of the bride and the bridegroom. Suppose the would
be husband and wife are born in Aquarius and Capricorn
respectively. At the time of marriage, the ascending Lagna
should be a sign other than Virgo or Leo as these two happen to
be the 8th from the bridegroom and bride's Janma Lagnas
respectively.

<p> 13. Rasi Visha Ghatika. - Elsewhere has been given the negative
periods of different Lagnas (Lagna Thyajya). They are to be
rejected for all auspicious work.

<p> 14. Kunavamsa Dosha. - The Lagna selected for an auspicious
work should not occupy the Navamsa of a malefic.

<p> 15. Varadosha. - This has already been explained on page 26.
Certain weekdays are to be avoided for certain special
activities.

<p> 16. Grahanothpatha Dosha. - The constellations in which the
eclipses appear should be avoided, and in regard to marriage,
such a constellation should be avoided for six months.

<p> 17. Ekargala Dosha. - This dosha is powerful only during the
daytime. Affects matters started under certain yogas such as
Vishkhambam. We need not go into details as it is not of much
significance.

<p> 18. Krura Samyuta Dosha. - The constellation occupied by the
Sun at a given moment, and the one immediately preceding and
succeeding it have to be deemed unpropitious for all good work
and they should be rejected for purposes of marriage.


<p> 19. Akalagharjitha Vrishti Dosha. - When there is rainfall and
thunder, out of season, such days should be deemed unfit for all
good work.

<p> 20. Mahapatha Dosha. - When the Sun and, the Moon are equally
removed from the equator upon the same side of it, the aspect is
known as Vyatipata, which indicates excess of evil. This is held
to be unfavourable for all good work.

<p> 21. Vaidhruthi Dosha - This is also an evil aspect (yoga) and
should be avoided in all favourable activities.

<p> I have given above a fairly clear description of the 'evils',
which are generally to be met with in all classical works on
Muhurtha. The reader should not get scared away at the thought
of these large number of doshas or planetary evils which are to
be avoided if one is to elect a proper time for the fruition of
an object in view. Man has to contend against a stupendous
number of evil agencies or discordant vibrations released by the
planetary bodies and each of these mahadoshas seems to express
euphemestically the particular types of evil energies which
would affect adversely particular types of human activities.
There are several exceptions to these general doshas. One should
always remember that in electing a suitable moment one should
try to avoid the major doshas by fortifying the ascendant and
taking advantage of the exceptions and ignoring the minor ones.

<p> The following combinations are held to neutralise the adverse
yogas mentioned above:

<p> 1. The lagnathyajya referred to supra prevails only on
particular days as per details below. In the first Navamsa -
Wednesday and Saturday. In the middle Navamsa - Monday and
Friday. In the last Navamsa - Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday. In
other days the thyajyam has no significance.

<p> 2. Chandrashtama shows no evil when the Moon is waxing and
occupies a benefic sign and a benefic Navamsa, or when there is
Tarabala. The sting is lost when the Moon and the 8th lord are
friends.

<p> 3. Tuesday is not evil after midday.

<p> 4. The aspects attributed to Vyatipatam, Vaidruti, etc., become
defunct after midday.

<p> 5. No day of the week is blemished if the lord thereof is
strongly placed in the election chart.

<p> 6. Venus, Mercury or Jupiter in the ascendant will completely
destroy all other adverse influences.

<p> 7. Jupiter has the power of dispelling all the evils due to the
Lagna, Navamsa and malefic aspects and render the time highly
propitious.

<p> 8. The mere presence of the Moon or the Sun in the 11th will
act as an antidote for other evils obtaining in the horoscope.

<p> 9. If the angles are well fortified, evil influences are
countered.

<p> 10. A planet exalted in Lagna will nullify the other adverse
influences.

<p> 11. Jupiter or Venus in a kendra (quadrant) and malefics in 3,
6 or 11 will remove alt the flaws arising on account of
unfavourable weekday, constellation, lunar day and yoga.

<p> Thus it will be seen that the most important question in
Muhurtha is the fortification of Lagna and its lord.


<h2><a name=6>CHAPTER VI<br>
On Certain Special Yogas</a></h2>

<p> When a certain weekday coincides with a certain asterism and a
certain lunar day, it becomes specialty auspicious for good
work. In this chapter, I shall give a few such special
combinations which go under the special distinction of Siddha
Yogas.

<p> Sunday coinciding with the 1st, 4th, 6th, 7th or 12th lunar day
and ruled by the constellations Pushya, Hasta, Uttara,
Uttarashadha, Moola, Sravana or Uttarabhadra gives rise to
Siddha Yoga.

<p> Monday identical with the 2nd, 7th or 12th lunar day and with
the constellations Rohini, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Chitta,
Sravana, Satabhisha, Dhanishta or Poorvabhadra produces the same
yoga.

<p> Tuesday falling on a day ruled by Aswini, Mrigasira, Chitta,
Anuradha, Moola, Uttara, Dhanishta or Poorvabhadra gives rise
to Siddha Yoga.

<p> Wednesday coinciding with Bhadra and Java and with the
constellations Rohini, Mrigasira, Aridra, Uttara, Uttarashadha
or Anuradha generates Siddha Yoga.

<p> Thursday identical with the 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 13th or 14th
lunar day and with tne asterisms Makha, Pushya, PunarvasJ,
Swati. Poorvashadha, Poorvabhadra, Revati or Aswini gives rise
to Siddha Yoga.

<p> Friday ruled by Aswini, Bharani, Aridra, Uttara, Chitta, Swati,
Poorvashadha or Revati coinciding with Nanda and Bhadra
constitutes this beneficial yoga.

<p> Saturday falling on a day ruled by Swati, Rohini, Visakha,
Anuradha, Dhanishta or Satabhisha and with lunar days Bhadra and
Riktha generates the same auspicious yoga.

<p> A Friday coinciding with Nanda (1st, 6th and 11th lunar days),
Wednesday identical with Bhadra (2nd, 7th and 12th lunar days),
Tuesday coinciding with Jaya (3rd 8th and 13th lunar days),
Saturday falling on a Riktha tithi (4th, 9th and 14th lunar
days), and Thursday falling on 5th, 10th or 15th (Poorna) lunar
days constitute Siddha Yoga.

<p> Sunday to Saturday respectively coinciding with the
constellations Hasta, Sravana, Aswini, Anuradha, Pushya, Revati
and Rohini will give rise to Amita Siddha Yoga.

<p> The above special yogas can be applied with advantage to
important elections and if in addition 10 the general strength
of the day due to a special yoga. the Lagna is also rendered
strong, chances of success of the enterprise would be by far the
greatest.


<h2><a name=7>CHAPTER VII<br>
Pre-Natal Ceremonies</a></h2>

<p> Before the actual birth of a child, three important ceremonies
are enjoined to be performed. They are nuptials (Nisheka),
consummation (Garbhadana) and Pumsavana (change of sex).

<p> Nisheka is used to denote the first sexual contact, while
Garbhadana has reference to the subsequent defloratiohs. Almost
ail the ancient works on Muhurtha start from Namakarana - the
name-giving ceremony after the birth of a child-but we start
from consummation as it is actually the beginning of the
pre-natal existence of the child. Sexual union, pregnancy and
reproduction of human species are the essentials on which the
world exists. Sexual union should never be based upon simple
sense gratification. There is a sacredness about sexual
functions, and when moral and spiritual considerations are not
respected and brought into play; the result will be most
unsatisfactory and alt sorts of undesirable progeny would be the
products of promiscuous cohabitation. According to Prof. B.
Suryanarajn Rao men and women are bundles of electricity. When
they are brought together sexually a series of electrical
currents would be released which may react on them favourably or
adversely depending upon the harmonious or discordant nature of
the vibrations released. Therefore the first sexual act should
not be treated lightly and should be done only when planetary
combinations are favourably disposed. Books on ancient Sexology
and Astrology reveal that to indulge in coitus during the first
four days of menses will lead to serious evil effects as the
whole physiological and nervous system of the woman would be in
a state of tension owing to the almost continuous discharge of
blood. So the first four days of menses should be avoided.
Copulation on the 5th day tends to give rise to a daughter. In
general, sexual union on odd days indicates birth of female
children while on even days. the birth of male children is
indicated. In the first instance, sexual union is highly
recommended on the 6th day of the menses as it is supposed to
ensure not only happiness to the couple but also the birth of a
dutiful and intelligent son.

<p> The constellations Sravana, Rohini, Anuradha, Swati, Revati,
Moola, Uttara, Uttarashadha, Uttarabhadra. Satabhisha are
highly favourable for nuptials. Pushyami, Dhanishta. Mrigasira,
Aswini, Chitta. Punarvasu are ordinary. The rest of
constellations are to be rejected.

<p> Monday, Wednesday. Thursday and Friday are auspicious days
while Saturday, Tuesday and Sunday should not be considered at
all.

<p> All lunar days-except the 4th, 8th, 9th, 14th, Full Moon and
New Moon are good. The favourable signs are Taurus to Libra and
Pisces. The birth star (Janma Nakshatra), the 10th star (Anu
Janma) and the 19th star (Thri Janma) should be avoided.

<p> At the time of nuptials, the 8th house should be occupied by no
planet. Subject to this proviso, even Sagittarius and Aquarius
may be selected as auspicious.

<p> Pumsavana. - This means change of sex. The Hindus had long ago
known the processes whereby the sex of the foetus could be
changed by performing certain remedies and by administering
certain medicines when sex differentiation is about to set in.
The possibility of change of sex long known to the Hindus was
being ridiculed by Western scientists. But during the last 3 or
4 decades, the opinion of the scientists underwent a gradual
change and most of them now admit such a possibility. For the
information of the reader, t may just make a few observations of
modern medical men on this all-important question.

<p> Professor Thury first started a theory about the possibility of
changing the sex of the foetus in the womb. This was taken up by
Professor Unterberger. Bernard Macfadden has reached certain
conclusions regarding the predetermination of the sex with a
success claimed in 90 per cent of cases experimented. According
to the theory of Thury "the biogenetic condition, prevailing in
the female organism in the beginning of the interval between two
menstrual periods is favourable to girls. Towards the end of
this interval, shortly before the new period, it is favourable
to boys. In between, the chances are even". It is possible that
the chemistry of the mother undergoes natural changes at certain
times which correspond to the condition of alkalinity on acidity
created artificially by Unterberger with the aid of bicarbonate
or lactic acid.

<p> There are, according to Davenport, probably four hundred
theories of sex determination promulgated during the last two or
three hundred years. One theory generally accepted by biologists
maintains that sex is determined by the so-called X chromosomes,
in the female there are two of these chromosomes. In the male
there is only one. Professor BIchm suggested that the male
chromosomes move more quickly in alkaline solution than the
chromosomes which carry the feminine principle. A teaspoonful
of bicarbonate of soda or one spoonful of lactic acid may thus
determine the sex of the child. Generally 105 boys are born for
every 100 girls. The mortality among the boys is somewhat
greater. It has been found that after great and destructive
wars, where men are killed on a large scale, the number of male
births increases. Nature thus restores the balance of sexes. We
have known parents, some of them longing for girls while others
want boys for keeping up their family traditions and for
continuance of their lines. This will be so specially in cases
of inheritance and succession to thrones and large landed and
financial estates. Many wars and bloodshed were the results of
kings and queens having no sons to succeed them. In almost all
the countries the dynasties were kept up through sons.
Matriarchy forms an exception.

<p> It was found out by experiment that a high acid secretion was
frequently responsible for sterility in the female. When douche
were applied in the form of sodium bicarbonate, where there were
no. pathological changes in either husband or wife the results
were most gratifying. The pregnancy developed after the next
period and in every case the child was a boy. Professor
Unterberger observes "that the most important thing appears to
be the fact that the characteristics of the female organs
exercise a great influence on the determination of the sex which
strange to say has been ignored heretofore". Professor Nicolai
Konstantinovitch of Moscow discovered an electric treatment
which separates and segregates the male and female spermatozoa.
It is said that children of either sex may be obtained by using
chromosomes of the opposite sex in artificial impregnation.
Natural spermatozoa are deposited in the curved end of the tube
filled with a physiological solution. A slight electrical
current draws the male and female cells opposite ends of the
tubes. The male spermatozoa are drawn to the anodes or the side
wh-,re the current enters the tube, and the female sperms to the
cathodes, where the current leaves. Macfadden says "conception
time with reference to the menstrual cycle normally runs its
course in twenty-eight days and so corresponds in length to the
lunar month".

<p> Here is a feminine physiological habit which in some ways at
present clearly understood closely corresponds to the movements
of the Moon. The theory is, that if fertilised when first
discharged from the ovary the ovum is female in tendency while
later as the ovum ages it becomes male, so that fertilisation
between the 3rd and the 5th days after menstruation is liable to
produce a girl, between the 5th and 8th days, a boy or a girl,
and between the 8th and 12th days a boy. We have evidence that
certain physiological habits curiously correspond to the lunar
dai!y cycles even as the habit of the menstruation, a sex
function corresponds to the lunar monthly cycle.

<p> It has been suggested by the mighty Darwin that since life
apparently originated on the beaches of primordial sea where it
was alternately covered and uncovered by the lides, through
countless ages, certain life rhythms and physiological habits
were formed in all living creatures to correspond with those
tidal rhythms, which irr-their turn were regulated by the Sun
and the Moon. The primitive cell, which was the cradle of the
life-force, at that time went through alternating period of
activity and quiescence. The scientific name for these two
physiological phases is Katabolism and Anabolism.
Physiologically Anabolism and Katabolism correspond to maleness
and femaleness. These facts lead to some interesting conclusions
about sex as possibly determined not merely by the time of the
lunar month, but by the time of the lunar day at which
conception takes place. Here all the greatest scientists on
matters of conception and sex formation are agreed on the
physiological effects of cycles of lunar days and lunar months.

<p> We shall now quote from our astrological literature, what
they have unanimously said about the appearances of menses, how
the foetus develops in the womb, in what month the sex is
formed, how the sex of the unborn child in the womb can be known
and by what methods the sex of the child may be changed as per
desire of the parents.

<p> Occassionally one reads in papers about the reversal or change
of sex to a certain degree even in adults. This phenomenon has
been actually witnessed by Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao and of late
it is becoming common. In the history of science the ancient
Hindus occupy a foremost place because thousands of years ago.
they had anticipated and in fact achieved what to the moderns
appear as marvels of biology. Of course, it is a fashion with
those who have received the European system of education of
laugh at things they cannot-explain with the aid of their own
pet theories.

<p> Charaka, the great Hindu physician, has dwelt at length with
the question of change of sex. The ancients had not only studied
the theory but they have given us practical rules whereby the
sex of the unborn child in the womb may be known in advance and
changed, if so desired. Ceremonies are actually laid down in
theVedas for performance by the father and the mother with a
view to give the child in the womb the sex that is desired.
These rites are called pwnsavana. The etymology of the word is:
pung (male) syate (is produced) anena (by this); in other words
the male-producing rite. These rites are performed even unto
this day by every orthodox Hindu. Pumsavana is performed just
after the expiration of three months from date of conception.

<p> Before giving further details about Pumsavana Jet us bring to
the attention of the readers an interesting phenomenon which
recently happened in Europe. Andreas Sparre, a Danish painter,
married at the age of 20, a student artist studying in a like
academy as his in Paris. They had a "happy life for some time.
A few years later Andreas Sparre happened to dress up in fun as
a woman. The clothes suited him and he looked like a girl. One
of his friends called him Lili and he liked this name. Soon
afterwards Andreas began to feel that Lili was after all a real
individual - a separate personality, existing within himself.
Gradually, this second personality pushed to the background, his
maleness. Andreas experienced bleeding from the mouth and nose
and this was regarded as a form of menstruation. Of course there
was a psychological change too that he was becoming moreand more
feminine. With the passing of time a conviction grew in his mind
that though male in his outward form, internally he possessed
the female sexual organs. Physicians and surgeons whom he
consulted could not offer any explanation for his dual
personality. At last he consulted a German specialist who
declared after a careful examination that Andreas possessed
female sexual organs within himself. After this he was operated
upon by Prof Gebherd and after the operation the attending
nurses remarked to Andreas that his voice had completely changed
and that it was a shrill woman's voice. Then cigarettes and
cigars nauseated him and even his handwriting turned feminine.
In this first operation the malesex glands were completely
removed and Andreas Sparre was no longer a man. After the second
operation Crete, the wife of Andreas, wrote as follows in her
diary: -

<p>"Not until a few hours later did I tearn what had happened
inside-a human being who was born a man, who was my husband, my
friend, my comrade had now become a woman, a complete woman."

<p>"But the thought which haunts me is that though Andreas may now
be extinguished, and though Liti may have risen like a phoenix
from the ashes, yet m the world outside Andreas is still living
in the eyes of the law, and I am his wife. Who is capable of
grasping this horror, this fantastic idea, this unique
happening."

<p>What are we to think of this strange and tragic case of Andhreas
Sparre - a case unique m medical history. The case of Obalamma
becoming Obalachari (vide Female Horoscopy by Prof. B.
Suryanarain Rao) is also equally interesting.

<p> Though medically it is impossible to distinguish sex in the
embryo, astrologically it is possible to know beforehand - based
on the conception Lagna-whether the child would be male or
female. Doctors also opine that even in the most normal and
unambiguous individual the rudiments of the organs of the other
sex are present throughout life. Pumsavana means not only rites
but also administering of certain medicines. Who knows, the
proper performance of Pumsavana may enable us to change sexes of
even adults, because the medicines accompanied by mantras may
act on the glandular secretions and change the very nature of
such secretion. The cases of Andreas and Obalamma suggest that
change of sex is possible and that ancient Hindus when they
talked of this phenomenon were not merely guessing but were
treading on solid and scientific ground*.

<p> A persual of the various texts in Sanskrit bearing on astrology
and medicine reveals that Pumsavana is closely connected with
the planetary influences on embroynic development. All the
phases of the union of the virile spermatozoan with the mature
ovum called impregnation, the fixation of the impregnated ovum,
called conception, and the development of the foetus are
governed by the Moon and other planets.

<p> No birth takes place by. chance. In most cases, impregnation
follows very shortly after coitus and it is the time of coitus
that is generally taken according to Hindu Astrology for the
Nisheka or conception horoscope. The period of gestation is the
time which elapses between the conception and partruition.
during which the child first as embryo, then as foetus is
developing in the womb. Beginning with the third week, the head
bend in the embryo is quite marked which gradually increases as
development goes on, and at the end of the third week the heart
and all the organs have been laid down and limbs begin to make
their appearance as small buds, not unlike those of the frog,
and the embryo closely resembles any other mammalian embryo at a
corresponding stage. The chief changes in the first month
(governed of course by Venus) are the formation of the face and
external ear, and the development of the limbs' The eyes, nasal
pits, maxillary processes, ears and nose are now visible.

<p> In the second month of pregnancy-ruled by Mars - the plasm is
enveloped by the amnion. Mars brings the development of the
membranes and strong expansion of them. The brain begins to
develop, the head becomes considerably larger and the human
characters are ell established. The embryo may now be spoken of
as the foetus, which has passed its quadruped stage.

<p> Now we come to the third month influenced largely by Jupiter -
the month in which Pumsavana has to be performed if one desires
to have a son born to him. ft Is In the third month the
differentiation of sex is brought about, as also the development
of the genitals. Jupiter a masculine planet, presides over this
month. Thus it will be seen that in the selection of the time
for performing Pumsavana the ancients had in view very
scientific reasons. As difference of sex occurs in the third
month, the medicines and mantras administered under the
influence of certain constellations would certainly be capable
enough to change the sex to the desire of. the individual
concerned. Without caring to bestow serious thought on such
questions, the moderner is apt to dismiss the whole thing as the
product of superstition.

<p> We shall now give a few hints from the famous Charaka Samhita
and it is for readers to make use of such hints to their own
advantage.

<p> Charaka says: "Instructions will be laid down about those Vedic
rites by which the sex of the child (in the womb) before its
manifestation may be changed. Verily of rites duly performed and
characterised by propriety of time and place, the capacity to
produce desirable fruits is ordained. Observing that a woman has
concieved, Pumsavana should be administered to her before the
manifestation of the sex of the child in the womb.

<p> "Obtaming two unbroken buds from two twigs procured from the
eastern and northern aides of a banian (Picus indica, Linn.)
growing in a cowpen, as also a single grain of paddy and a
single seed of Masha Phaseolus radiatus Roxb.) both well
developed, or two seeds of white mustard, and throwing them into
a quantity of curds, the woman (that has conceived) should be
made to drink it under the constellation of Pushya." Another
Pumsavanam medicine is the following: -

<p> The kalka or paste of (a) jeevaka(*1) (b) rfshabhaka(*2) (c)
Apamarga(*3) or (d) Sahachara(*4) or of each if desirable -
should be boiled with milk and given to the woman to drink.

<hr>
<p>1. Jeeaka Is no longer identifiable or procurable. Hindu doctors
find substitute In Guduchi or Tinospora cordifolia. Miqs.

<p>2. This is also not Identifiable. The substitute to
Vanggatochana or bamboo manoa.

<p>3. Achyaranihes, Linn.

<p>4. Barlenia cristala, Linn.
<hr>

<p> "Or, the likeness of a man. or very small proportions, made of
gold, or silver or iron, made red-hot in fife and then dipped
into a measure of curds, or milk, or water, should be swallowed
without leaving any remnant, under the influence of the
constellation Pushyami. Under the same nakshatra of Pushymi, the
woman may be made to inhale the hot vapour of a cake {pishta or
pishtaka} that is being baked (on the fire) and then dissolving
that cake in a measure of water, the mixture should be cast over
the threshold of the door. This water the woman should then,
using a stick of cotton, apply to her Tight nostril."

<p> If the above remedies are administered under the favourable and
auspicious influences of constellation, the sex in the womb of
the woman is supposed to change. The subject is vast and we
shall again recur to this on a subsequent occasion. Who has
studied and who has tested all these methods? Why label them as
useless and unscientific when you do not know that they are.

<p> The ceremony of Pumsavanam should be celebrated in the 3rd
month when signs of pregnancy are evident. All lunar days
except the 4th, 6th, 8th. 9th, 12th. 14th. Full Moon and New
Moon days are good.

<p> All signs except Gemini, Cancer and Virgo are auspicious. Virgo
should be avoided as it is specially adverse.

<p> Monday. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are beneficial. The 8th
house from the ascendant should be vacant. The Moon's presence
in Lagna or the 12th and the ascendant being aspected by Venus
brings on prosperity. Beneficsshould be disposed in quadrants or
trines.

<p> There is another ceremony named Seemantha immediately foltowtng
Pumsavansm. being performed In the 5th or 7th month of
pregnancy. This is ortfatned only in regard to first
conceptions. If the time-schedule cannot be kept up. it should
not be abandoned, but the function must be performed at least
before delivery. This is the view of sage Sankha.

<p> For Seemantha, Rohini, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Uttara,
Uttarashadha, Hasta, Sravana and Revati are auspicious. Some are
of the opinion that under unavoidable circumstances, even
Aswini, Anuradna and Moola maybe deemed auspicious. The 4th,
6th, 8th, 9th, 14th (unar days and New Moon day must be avoided.
When the Moon is dignified Full Moon day is hot condemned.
Sunday. Tuesday and Saturday should be avoided. The rest of the
weekdays are good. All signs except Leo and Scorpio are
auspicious. The 8th house from the ascendant must be free.
Generally speaking, the 3rd, 8th, 7th, 10th and 22nd
constellations should be avoided. The Moon should not be in the
8th house. So far as this particular ceremony is concerned, the
month ranks first in importance. Hence, even If Jupiter and
Venus are combust, such a circumstance may be ignored.


<h2><a name=8>CHAPTER VIII<br>
Post-Natal Ceremonies</a></h2>

<p> Namakarana or naming tha child. - The proper day for this
ceremony would be the 10th, 12th or 16th day of the child's
birth. If this is not possible, then an auspicious day must be
fixed for the purpose.

<p> Anuradha, Punarvasu, Makha, Uttara, Uttarashadha, Uttarabhadra,
Satabhisha, Swati, Dhanishta, Sravana, Rohini, Aswini,
Mrigasira, Revati, Hasta and Pushya are auspicious.

<p> The 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 12th, l4th lunar days; Full Moon and
New Moon should be avoided.

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are good. Other
weekdays are not good. As far as possible, the Lagna roust be
rendered strong and the 8th house should be unoccupied. Fixed
signs are preferable and common signs are good when occupied by
benefics.

<p> If Jupiter occupies a kendra or thrikona and a malefic is in
the 11th the time is held to be very auspicious. Another
equally propitious combination ie the time when the Lagna falls
in's benefic sign with a malefic in the 3rd, Venus in 12th and
the Moon in a dignified bosrtion.

<p> Generally the name to be given to a male child should consist
of an even number of letters (e.g., Rama, Krishna, etc.), while
a female child should be given a name containing uneven number
of letters e.g., Parvati, Janaki, etc.). The name must also be
appropriate to the ruling star.

<p> Cradling. - The best time for this would be the 10th, 12th,
16th, or the 22nd day after its birth.

<p> First Feeding on Rico (Annaprasana). - Let the first feeding on
rice be done in the 6th, 8th, 9th, or 12th month on days ruled
by Aswini, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Dhanishta, Pushyami, Hasta,
Swati, Anuradha, Sravana, Satabhisha, Uttara, and Chitta,
avoiding the usual unfavourable lunar days. The 10th house must
be unoccupied. The first feeding should not be done in the
constellation of Aridra, Krittika, Jyeshta, Bharani, Aslesha,
Poorvashadha and Poorvabhadra.

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are good. Aries.
Scorpio and Pisces are inauspicious. Mercury, Mars and Venus
should not occupy respectively the 7th, 8th and 9th houses.
Mercury, Jupiter or Venus in Lagna is highly commendable. No
malefic should occupy the ascendant.

<p> The most important factor in this function is the month; hence
one should not mind even if Jupiter and Venus are combust.

<p> Ear Boring (Karnavedha). - This should be done on the 12th oil
6th day of the birth of the child or in the 6th, 7th or 8th
month, either in the forenoon or in the afternoon but never
during night. A day ruled by two asterisms or two lunar days is
not propitious as also the other lunar days usually declared as
inauspicious.

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are good.
At the time of boring the ears, the 8th house should be
unoccupied, Aquarius, Leo and Scorpio <bould be
rejected.

<p> Tonsure (Chowlam) - The learned say that Chowlam is a very
important karma because it involves the first cutting of hair
which means discharge of electrical currents from the child for
the first time. The ceremony when properly done is said to
prolong the life of the child. It should not be done when the
mother of the child is pregnant. Chowlam may be performed in the
3rd or 5th year when Jupiter and Venus are free from combustion
and when the Sun is in the Tropic of Cancer. The bright
fortnight is said to give longevity while the dark fortnight is
supposed to affect the health.

<p> The 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, 11th and 13th lunar days are
good. The 4th, 1st, 6th, 8th, 9th, 14th and New and Full Moon
days should be rejected.

<p> Punarvasu, Mrigasira, Dhanishta, Sravana, Revati, Pushya,
Chitta, Aswini, Hasta are favourable; Swati, Rohini, Satabhisha,
Uttara, Uttarabhadra, Uttarashadha are ordinary. Tonsure should
always be done in the forenoon.

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are good.

<p> Cancer, Virgo, Gemini, Pisces, Libra, Taurus and Capricorn
rising give rise to good results. The rest are not beneficial.
But they can be employed provided benefics occupy the Lagna and
the Lagna is otherwise strong. But Aquarius should be rejected
at any cost, no matter how powerful it might be. Let the
benefics occupy the 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th and
malefics the 3rd, 6th and 11th. The 8th house must femain
unoccupied. The 7th house should not be occupied by either the
Sun or Mars or preferably by any malefic.

<p> Commencing Education (Aksharabhyasa}. - Alphabet is a crude
translation of the word 'Akshara'. Akshara means that which
cannot be destroyed and therefore akshara simply indestructible
forms of sound vibrations.

<p> When such sound vibrations are first put into the child's ears,
they must be such as to give the child a good chance of calling
out the latent energies in him or her so that the course of
training may run smoothly and to his best advantage.

<p> The most propitious period for commencing education is the
6th day in the 5th month of the 5th year. The following days
constellations are good: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday; Aswini, Punarvasu, Aridra, Hasta, Chitta, Swati, Sravana
and Revati.

<p> Movable and common signs are good.

<p> Forenoon and noon are preferable. The 8th house should be
unoccupied.

<p> Mercury, Venus, Jupiter in the 9th counteracts all evil
influences.

<p> Investiture of Sacred Thread (Upanayanam)*. - This is a
ceremony in which spiritiual instructions are given by
authorised persons to give spiritual eye to the boy by which his
internal vision is brought closer to the Universal light or God.
This ceremony is peculiar to the Hindus. But as the name
indicates, any section of the human society, whether Hindu or
not, may take advantage of these valuable precepts and begin to
give their children the religious instruction most suitable to
their countries, castes and traditions, Upanayanam should be
performed in the 5th or the 8th year. If this is not possible,
the ceremoney should be gone through before the age of 16 In
case of Brahmins and 20 to 24 in regard to other sects of the
Hindus.

<hr>
<p>* Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao's Sukla and Promoduta.
<hr>

<p> The Sun, the Moon and Jupiter represent symbolically the
father, mother and lire-force. Therefore, the three planets
should be well disposed to the ascendant at the timeof
Upanayanam.

<p> The best season is when the Sun is in his northern course
(between Capricorn and Gemini). The lunar months of Magha,
Phalguna, Chaitra and Vaisakha are good. The 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th,
10th and 13th lunar days in the bright half and the 1st. 2nd and
3rd in the dark half are held to be auspicious. The lunar days
to be avoided are 4th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, 14th and Full and
New Moon days. Some are of opinion that the 13th is good.

<p> Exception: Even the 14th lunar day may be treated as good if
the boy is above the prescribed age.

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are propitious. Wednesday
must be rejected if Mercury Is combust. Sunday is ordinary
while Tuesday should be invariably rejected.

<p> The following constellations are good: Anuradha, Hasta, Chitta,
Swati, Sravana, Dhanishta, Satabhisha, Uttara, Uttarashadha,
Uttarabhadra, Revati, Rohini, Mrigasira, Aswini, Punarvasu and
Pushyami.

<p> Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Virgo, Libra and Aquarius are
good. The other signs should be avoided. According to Vasishta
and Garga. the 3rd day in the bright half of the month of
Chaitra and Vaisakha and the 7th day in the bright half of the
lunar months Magha and Phalguna are highly favourable.

<p> The Moon must not occupy the 6th, 8lth, or 12th house. Malefics
should not be posited in quadrants. The ceremony should take
place before noon. The 8th house from the Lagna must be
unoccupied.

<p> The third house should be fortified by the situation of either
malefics or benefics, white the 6th should be devoid of a
benefic. Mars and Saturn should be avoided in the 5th.

<p> Let Mars and Saturn be avoided in the 2nd from the election
chart; as otherwise they will make the boy's intellect dull.
Similarly their situation in the 12th should also be avoided.
The Moon should always be avoided in Lagna. But, however, if
Cancer is the ascendant and the Moon and Jupiter are in
conjunction and malefics are in 3, 6 and 11, the evil attached
to the situation of the Moon in Lagna becomes neutralised. The
following malefic yogas should also be avoided:

<p> Spoorjitham. - The Sun in kendra causes this yoga and the
result is the destruction of the family.

<p> Spuritham. - Mars occupying a kendrs generates this evil yoga
and generally proves fatal to the Guru (preceptor) as well as
the boy.

<p> Rudhitham. - Saturn occupying a kendra produces this evil
combination resulting in incurable diseases.

<p> Rundhram. - Rahu in a kendra gives rise to this malefic yoga.
It proves fatal to the mother.

<p> Ugram. - This arises by Ketu's disposition in a kendra. It
adversely affects health and education.

<p> Besides the above malefic yogas, the Moon should not be
affected by Mercury as it leads to the boy's blindness. The Moon
should not be in her own Navamsa, nor in that of the Sun or
Mars.

<p> The following are of course very favourable combinations for
Upanayanam:

<p> (1) The 6th, 7th or 8th house from the Moon being occupied by a
benefic.

<p> (2) The Sun or Venus in the 12th, Mercury in the 2nd and
Jupiter in a trine or a quadrant.

<p> (3) Venus in Lagna. Mercury in the 10th, the Sun tn the 11th
and the Moon in a benefic navamsa.

<p> (4) When the Lagna is Pisces occupied by Jupiter or Venus with
the Sun In the 11th and Mercury in the 10th or 12th house.

<p> (6) Gemini rising with Mars in Aries. Venus in Taurus and the
Moon in Cancer.


<h2><a name=9>CHAPTER XI<br>
Marriage</a></h2>

<p> Marriage is a most complicated structure made up as it is of a
whole series of subjective and objective facts of a very
heterogeneous nature. Since we are concerned with the
psycho-astrological aspect of marriage we shall exclude the
objective factors of legal and social nature although these
factors have a pronounced influence on the psychological
relationship of the married pair.

<p> Marriage is not an institution for simple brute sense
gratification. The idea that it is a civil contract terminable
at will smacks of meanness in conception of the grand
liabilities and assets between the parties to be engaged in
sacred wedlock. One of the great American judges said "the
contract of marriage is something more than a civil agreement
between the parties, the extent of which only affects
themselves. It is the basis of the family, and its dissolution
as well as its formation is a matter of public policy in which
the body or community is deeply interested and it is to be
governed by other considerations than those which obtain with
regard to any other civil contract that the ground which shall
invalidate the contract must be something more than a mere
representation as to collateral matters that no ground will
annul a marriage which does not go to the very essence of the
contract".

<p> Marriage, both in the social and economic sense, is a sexual
relationship entered into with the intention of making it
permanent. In India, marriage was and is regarded as a religious
sacrament and marriage comprehends the equality of the partner
in respect of Dharma (right conduct), Artha (financial
position), Kama (sex relation) and Moksha (final salvation). The
universality of marriage constitutes one of the most striking
differences between the Hindus and the other races* When the
question of marriage is considered, various factors demand our
attention, important ones being physical fitness, mental
qualities, heredity, sexual compatibility and social and
economic status.

<p> In the modern world so much is made of the sex element in
marriage that the other equally important factors, social and
psychological, are practically ignored. The Hindu Sastras,
having in view the climatic and ethnological conditions of
India, have fixed the maximum and minimum age limits for
marriage. Marriages between parties belonging to the same Gotra
are not favoured perhaps because of the dysgenic influence on
the offspring. Inter-racial, intercommunal and inter-religious
marriages are not looked upon favourably because in such matches
there are cultural differences.

<p> After a careful consideration of all these factors, the Hindus
had devised an astrological means of judging marriage
compatibility whereby the relations between the couple may stand
the strain of maladjustments. Pseudosexologists and sociologists
are not wanting in India who are ever ready to point out their
finger of contempt at the sound and sensible institution of
marriage developed by the Hindus after centuries of experience
and experiments. We are not concerned with such socialistic
theories advocating companionate marriage and encouraging
unbridled licence in love affairs. They may be all right in
countries like Russia and America - the melting pots of
different races. But they cannot hold water in a country like
India whose civilisation, culture and social laws are peculiar
to her geographical and historical positions.

<p> The Hindus have solved this complex problem of marriage
selection by recourse to astrological considerations, If
investigations into the various kutas are undertaken before the
marriage is contracted, there will perhaps be fewer tragedies
than at present and less marital infidelity. Modern science has
devised no means to find out the compatibility between the
marrying couple. Sexologists suggest that the bride and
bridegroom should subject themselves to a thorough medical
examination. Although this sounds reasonable, it makes an
important omission in that mere physical fitness does not ensure
complete marital happiness. Happiness largely rests upon so many
other factors that the aid of astrology should be sought for by
every sensible individual.

<p> In selecting horoscopes for marriage purposes, three
factors have to be carefully considered. They are: -

<p> (a) The longevity of the bride and the bridegroom.

<p> (b) The larger strength of the 7th and 8th houses.

<p> (c) Agreeability in regard to the Kutas or pooruththam.

<p> When there is no longevity in the case of bride, the horoscope
must be rejected even though the 7th house may be strong or the
requsite number of units are available. Likewise when the 7th
house is weak and is considerably blemished, the horoscope to be
matched should have antidotes or counteracting influences.

<p> The kutas or the units of agreement should be considered only
when there is general sympathy between the horoscopes of the
parties to be brought together. The existing practice almost all
over India and particularly in the South is highly defective and
dangerous as horoscopes are rejected simply because they do not
conform to certain kutas, while the most important factors such
as longevity, widowhood, etc., are completely ignored.

<p> Therefore it is very essential to examine to start with, the
general strength of the chart; and when good longevity is
indicated in both horoscopes and they are free from the
afflictions in regard to the 7th and 8th houses, further
agreement should be judged. When Mars and; Venus are in the 7th,
the boy or girl concerned will have strong sex-instincts and
such an individual should be mated to one who has similar
instincts and not a person having Mercury or Jupiter in the 7th,
as this makes one under-sexed. When sexual incompatibility sets
in marriage, life proves charmless and friction arises between
the couple. Therefore it is the duty of the parents to consult
learned astrologers and not to entrust the work of comparing
horoscopes to all persons who have no practical experience.
History is replete with ill-matched marriages and the most
miserable lives the couples had to live.

<p> Socrates philosopher as he was reputed to be, was united in
marriage to Xantippe who, if rightly reported, perpetually
ridiculed his philosophical teachings and mercilessy nagged him
in his home. Once when he had invited a distinguished friend to
dinner, she spitefully emptied the contents of a vessel upon his
head. Plato sympathisingly asked him why he bore such
indignities Meekly replied the old philosopher: "She teaches me
patience and charity, and shows to me that if I can bear with
her. I can bear all else in the world". Alcibiades, noted for
brilliancy of intellect and a most graceful carriage of
personality, was strangely unfortunate in his marital relations.
Too proud to directly desert his wife he at one time
contemplated and even attempted suicide as a release from his
bonds.

<p> Pericles, ruling Athens for 50 years, finding it brick and
leaving it marble, was not only orator and statesman, but in
other ways the most discrete and majestic character of that
remote period. His relations with Aspasia caused bitterest
criticism. His wife. being a fault finding social drag, failing
to stand by him supporting him in his great work for the
upholding of Athens, he deliberately parted with her. bestowing
upon her half of his estates.

<p> Plato, warned by Socrates, his teacher, though noble, wealthy,
scholastic and exceedingly popular in the higher walks of
Grecian society never married, though a great admirer and lover
of women.

<p> Cicero, the Roman orator and early pleader in the forum,
studied at the feet of Zeno and Demetrius and married the
heiress Terentia.

<p> It is needless to produce the full story of his unsatisfactory
married life. Milton, holding in English literature one of the
highest places as poet and patriot, wrote three pamphlets upon
divorce and lived not merely unhappily but at times miserably
with his wife, Mary Powell.

<p> Thomas Carlyle's married life was rough, as a tempestuous sea
and accordingly far from being happy. Dickens, as writer,
author and world painter of human emotions, stood for a time in
Great Britain unrivalled and yet his matrimonial home life was a
most painful failure.

<p> We can multiply the instances any number. In the modern times,
America counts such social shipwrecks by thousands upon
thousands both in the lower and the higher planes of marital
life. In India also the number is on the increase. All these
tell their own sad stories of connubial dissatisfaction arid
family wretchedness. Readers must note that in the example's
given above, the married lives were not shattered by the death
of wife, or husband but they proved tragic because of the
dislike between husband and wife.

<p> Having read the above paragraphs, the reader may be tempted to
put the question "Is marriage - true harmonial marriage -
possible at the present state of the world's civilisation?" The
quick answer is in the affirmative.

<p> A careful consideration of the important astrological works
reveals, the following information: -

<p> (1) If Kuja is in the 7th house unaspected or not joined by
benefics, there will be frequent quarrels in the married life
often leading to misunderstandings and separation.

<p> (2) When Saturn is in the 8th house, and particularly in a
square to Mars. the married life will be crossed by discord,
lack of mutual understanding and want of real attachment.

<p> (3) When Leo is Lagna and the 7th lord Saturn is in the 2nd,
the husband will be subservient to the wife carrying out all her
orders.

<p> (4) Saturn in the 7th house is also indicative of unhappiness
in marriage unless Saturn happens to be either lord of Lagna or
lord of the 7th.

<p> (5) According to *Prasna Marga. the famous Kerala work on
Astrology, if the Sun and Venus occupy the 5th, 7th, or 9th
house then the native will lack marital happiness.

<hr>
<p>* See English translation of Prasiia Marga by Or. B. V. Raman.
<hr>

<p> (6) A strong malefic in the 4th, particularly Mars, is not
conducive to conjugal happiness.

<p> (7) If in the Ashtakavarga of Venus, the 7th house from Venus
contains a large number of bindus (positive units) and the wife
is born in any of the asterisms of the Sun, then his wife will
be as dear to him as life.

<p> (8) When the longitude of the 7th house falls in a malefic
Navamsa, frequent quarrels and misunderstandings will ensue.

<p> (9) If the lords of the 7th and 1st are friends then the native
will be loved by his wife. Otherwise there will be no harmony.

<p> The above combinations do not speak of either the death of wife
or more than one marriage. They simply state that the
dispositions of planets in a certain manner in the (male's or
female's) horoscope, render the marital life unhappy.

<p> (10) Make the necessary reductions in the Ashtakavarga* of
Venus. Mark those signs that contain bindus or dots. Then take
that sign which contains more dots and get the bride from the
direction indicated by that sign. The marriage is said to bring
real happiness.

<p> We should like to make a few observations based on
our studies and experience.

<p> Today in the Western countries, one in every three marriages is
said to end in divorce. Love, affection and loyalty appear to be
inconsistent or out of date with a gadget-geared, money-mad and
permissive society. During our last visit to U.S., Mrs. X who
drove us from Washington to New York narrated her tale, which is
briefly as follows: - A lawyer by profession, Mrs. X, 28, had
married another lawyer, after "knowing him well" and had a son
from him. Two years of their married life crossed by frequent
quarrels, "temperamental clashes", etc., resulted in divorce
proceedings. The possession of the child was given by the court
to the father. The mother Mrs. X revolted and she became
miserable. She was seeking astrological advice whether she could
marry another attorney who was in similar predicament having
divorced his first wife.

<p> This case is typical of many American marriages. Mrs X had met
an Indian lady and had been astonished to learn that in India
most marriages "were arranged" by the parents and that the very
idea of divorce was stilt repugnant to the average Indian lady.
And she was also told that astrology played a vital role in the
selection of parents; all of which astonished her so much that
she began to study astrology and "felt convinced" that Indian
Society had certain in-built safety valves which made marriages
stable; and that despite the free mixing of sexes and the
permissive nature of man-woman relations in the West, astrology
could be of immense value in the selection of brides and
bridegrooms, so that the incidence of divorce could be reduced
to some extent.

<p> Thanks to the intellectual slavery of the Indians some of the
"progressives" are now clamouring for the introduction of
sex-education in schools and colleges in India" Mindly aping the
Westerners and unmindful of the jeopardising of the moral basis
and sancitity of man and woman relations.

<p> Paradoxically it is now being felt in many Western countries
that the so cailed sex education instead of being "enlightening"
by way of imparting "scientific truths" and "natural biological
functions" is completely deviod of moral guidance and has
resulted in an improper sensationalistic approach on the part of
young students, because sex is viewed from the Freudian point of
view as mere biological function and not from the Jungian point
of view, as a vital force capable of being directed through
creative channels.

<p> Today the tragedy of India appears to be that Indian people are
to be considered as guinea pigs for experimenting with theories,
once fashionable in the west, and now being increasingly
rejected as adversely influencing the stability of marriage and
family fife.

<p> Recently an enterprising Indian scholar had a German professor
of Sociology as his guest: The German professor remarked that he
found the institution of marriage much more of a success in
India and that he could feel the presence of deeper harmony in
domestic relations In India than in any other civilised region
if had so far visited"

<p> The Indian professor's reply was that this stabilrty and
harmony were probably due to the system of martrimonial matching
of horoscopes, invariably resorted to by parents prior to the
settling of marriages. The Indian scholar started collecting
case histories of married couples and he managed to get 603
cases for study. The age group selected was 30 to 40. All the
people concerned were born between 1931-40 and married between
1955-60. The economic background was mostly rural and
agricultural though 22% of the case histories concerned people
who derived their livelihood from commercial and industrial
occupations. In most cases the informants were males. It was
found that divorces and separations were 6% and deaths of
husbands or wives 10%. The scholar's findings were that 47% was
positive, 42% neutral and 11% negative. By positive he means
very successful marriages. By neutral he means a fair degree of
harmony in domestic lives. And by negative he means
disharmonious family lives. His conclusion is that these figures
prove the efficacy of astrology in marital settlements.

<p> The interrelations between the planetary and stellar positions
and the sentiments of men and women are very intimate. Apart
from the other astrological considerations, mutual dispositions
of Mars and Venus are to be carefully considered. It cannot be a
coincidence that divorce, separation and crimes of passion
increase whenever there is a conjunction of Venus and Mars in
the heavens, especially when the constellations involved are
those of malefic planets. The Venus-Mars configuartion could of
course be one of the contributing factors. Children born when
there is a Venus-Mars conjunction should be brought up in a
disciplined manner and should be made to avoid dissipating
habits of immediate pleasure. The adverse effects of the
conjunction could be made to express through constructive
channels if Jupiter aspects the combination or is or is in a
quadrant therefrom,

<p> Venusis indeed associated with many fascinating aspects of
life. He rules the wife, conveyance, sex harmony and union, art,
attachment, family happiness, marriage in general, vitality,
fertility, physical beauty and frtendliness.

<p> Mars abounds in energy, aggressiveness, fortitude, driving
force and in association with Venus, a tendency to excess of
sensual gratification.

<p> It is therefore necessary that in the horoscopes of the couple.
Mars-Venus conjunction or opposition should have a benefic
steadying effect of a favourable disposition of Jupiter; or in
the alternative the conjunction or opposition takes place in the
constellations of Jupiter, Mercury or even Venus; Jupiter and
Mercury being more preferable.

<p> Venus-Mars disposition is an important factor for physical
attraction. But in the absence of Jupiter's or even Saturn's
benign influence, real compatibility may be lacking. Venus-Mars
conjunction makes one fond of pleasure, demonstrative and adds
zest to one's sensual life. When Venus and Mars are involved in
adverse aspects, difficulty through excesses and trouble through
marriage follow as a matter of consequence. Venus in a good sign
or constellation can temper the roughness of Mars, but if Rahu
is also involved, it makes one lascivious, lowed and wicked.
Whether in the horoscope of a boy or a girl, Ketu-Venus-Mars
association (or even mutual aspect) is not desirable unless the
constellation involved belongs to Jupiter or Mercury or even
benefic Moon, though the last circumstance might render the
native's thinking highly sensual. Ketu-Venus-Mars (or Saturn)
denotes danger of scandal in marriage. But if the 10th or house
of Karma is well disposed, the affliction becomes somewhat
tempered.

<p> Let us take the example of a person having Venus-Mars
conjunction in Taurus, the Lagna being Scorpio. Venus,
Kalatrakaraka in the 7th, is not generally favoured by ancient
writers on the theory of karakobhavanasaya as the indications of
the 7th house are said to be inhibited. Experience has however
revealed that this textual dictum is not quite valid. In fact
Venus in the 7th is one of the finest combinations for a fairly
happy marriage, denoting affection and attachment between the
couple. When in the case under reference, Venus is in Krittika
ruled by the Sun and Mars in Mrigasira, the 7th house gains
considerable strength and the married life will be happy though
crossed by frequent emotional clashes. If such a native is
married to one who has Taurus rising with Venus and Mars in
Scorpio, each will constantly try to appease the dictates of
others' emotions and overindulge in sensual pleasures to the
detriment of their health. Venus in Taurus is good, but in a
fiery constellation (Krittika) it gives rise to stubborness. In
Rohini, on the other hand, the finer qualities of Venus find
expression. It is always better to look for trinal or
quadrangular dispositions of Mars and Venus from the Lagna or
the Moon, no matter even if they conjoin provided, they are in
different constellations. A similar disposition in the partner's
horoscope is desirable though not essential.

<p> Just for illustration we give below a chart which is typical of
a broken marriage. The native being a Hindu there was no legal
divorce.

<p> Lord of the 7th Mars is in the 11th in combination with Rahu
both in the constellations of Venus and aspected by Saturn
posited in the constellation of Ardra Venus. Kalatrakaraka in
his turn, is much afflicted by association with Ketu, situated
in the constellation of Rahu and aspected by Mars. Both the lord
of the 7th and Venus have been much afflicted. The native
married the daughter of a highly placed and respected officer.
Before marriage, the girl's father had been advised to reject
the boy as the girl's married life would not only suffer from
untold misery, as the native could become a debauchee but she
could be even rejected, the marriage took place. And to the
amazement of the wife, she found that her husband was leading a
profligate life and never loved her. All her attempts to wean
him away from his evil ways failed, and from sheer disgust, the
lady returned to her parent's house. The sensual life led by the
native resulted in his contacting dreadful venereal complaints.

<p> One cannot decide the make-up of a person - boy or girl -
merely on the basis of.the Moon's situation, though one can
glean a few psychological facts. It is the total assessment of
each horoscope that is to be considered before applying the
tests for mutual compatibility.

<p> In a number of charts of husbands and wives we have studied,
the following peculiarities have been noticed.

<p> When Venus, Mars and Jupiter in one horoscope are situated in
the other horoscope in a trine or in an angle of 3 and 11
positions, that is, if in the husband's horoscope, Venus is in
Taurus and in the wife's horoscope, in Cancer or Virgo or
Scorpio, it is a favourable position. When the Sun and the Moon
have similar harmonious positions, except 2 and 12
(dwirdwadasa), there is usually a strong attachment. Here again
if the husband's Sun is in Cancer and the wife's in Virgo, the
needed harmnnv exists. When the Sun and the Moon are disposed as
suggested above but Mars in one case is in a sign which happens
to be the 12th from Venus in the other horoscope, attachment
exists, but there cannot be normal happiness in their private
lives. If Venus in one horoscope is in a sign occupied by Saturn
in the other a serious and industrious partner is indicated.
Mars in the 7th, unaspected by benefics, indicates-frequent
quarrels leading to misunderstandings. Saturn in the 8th,
aspected by Mars (especially 4th or 8th house aspect), is not
conducive to mutual understanding. Saturn in the 7th confers
stability in the marriage but the, husband or wife manifests
coldness and not warmth. A strong malefic in the 4th affects
married happiness unless neutralised by a benefic aspect. If the
Janma Rasi of the wife (or husband) happens to be the Lagna of
the husband (or wife), or if the Lagna of the wife (or husband)
(happens to be the 7th (in the Horoscope) from the position of
the lord or the 7th (in the other) the married life will be
stable and built on mutual understanding and affection.

<p> When certain afflictions are present in one horoscope it is
said that they could be mitigated by having the native married
to a partner whose horoscope has similar afflictions.

<p> After satisfying on the basis of the birth horoscopes about the
bride's (or bridegroom's) character, health, general mental
soundness, the agreement between the two horoscopes is to be
judged.

<p> When evil combinations indicating misery in married life are
present in the horoscope of a bride, then the same can be
mitigated by marrying her to a boy whose horoscope has similar
evil combinations. The evils can also be avoided by testing the
marriage adaptability and by performing the marriages in proper
Muhurthas.

<p> Therefore with a view to avoid such unpleasant consequences,
the astrological works of the Maharshis have laid down certain
units of strength and agreement and when these are agreeable,
the married couple would live happily in spite of external and
physical discomforts like poverty, etc.

<p> The Maharshis have claimed that by electing a proper time or
Muhurtha for marriage, several of the evil indications in the
charts of the couple can be minimised to a great extent.

<p> In this chapter, I have confined myself to the elucidation of
rules governing marriage adaptability. It is presumed that
before applying these rules, the horoscopes have been judged
already in regard to the 7th and 8th houses.

<p> There are 12 factors, to be considered in order to judge the
suitability for a proposed matrimonial alliance out of which
eight are supremely important. They are: (1) Dina, (2) Gana,
(3) Mahendra, (4) Stree-Deergha, (5) Yoni, (6) Rasi, (7)
Rasyadhipathi, (8) Vasya, (9) Rajju, (10) Vedha, (11) Varna, and
(12) Nadi.

<p> In order to illustrate these principles, we shall consider the
horoscopes of a male and a female born in Mrigasira and
Satabhisha respectively. It is assumed that the 7th and 8th
houses are not only strong but are mutually well disposed.

<p> 1. Dina Kuta. - Count the constellation of the boy from that of
the girl and divide the number by 9. If the remainder is 2, 4,
6, 8 or 0 it is good. The number of units of compatibility
assigned to this Kuta is 3 in case agreement is found.

<p> Example: - The constellation of the boy (viz., Mrigasira in
Taurus) counted from that of the girl (Dhanishta in Makara)
gives 10. This divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 1 and hence
there is no agreement, and no units of strength are scored on
this account.

<p> 2. Gana Kuta. - This seems to have an important bearing on the
temperament and character of the couple concerned. Compatibility
of temperament and not of course identity of temperament is
called for in astrology. A difference of temperament may be
harmonious and complimentary. But a compatibility of temperament
is essential to a satisfactory marriage union. Astrologically
three Ganas (temperaments of natures) are recognised viz., Deva
(divine), Manusha (human), and Rakshasa (diabolical). Deva
represents piety, goodness of character end charitable nature.
Manusha is a mixture of good and bad, while Rakshasa suggests
dominance, self-will and violence. These different natures are
indicated by the birth, constellation. A distaste for piety and
religious disposition cannot be easily associated with piety and
religious nature. A difference in beliefs and dogmas cannot
always be overbalanced by sexual compatibility. Hence one born
in a Deva constellation is not able to get on well with a person
born in Rakshasa constellation. A Deva can marry a Deva, a
Manusha can marry a Manusha and a Rakshasa can marry a Rakshasa.

<p> Manusha or a Deva man should not marry a Rakshasa girl unless
there are other neutralising factors. But marriage between a
Rakshasa man and a Deva or Manusha girl is passable. If marriage
is brought about between prohibited Ganas there will be quarrels
and disharmony. So that the couple would always welcome an
opportunity for separation and divorce. The following
constellations denote the different Ganas: -

<p> Deva Gana. - Punarvasu, Pushyami, Swati, Hasta, Sravana,
Revati, Anuradha, Mrigasira and Aswini.

<p> Manusha Gana. - Rohini, Pubba, Poorvashadha, Poorvabhadra,
Bharani, Aridra, Uttara, Uttarashadha and Uttarabhadra.

<p> Rakshasa Gana. - Krittika, Aslesha, Makha, Chitta, Visakha,
Jyeshta, Moola, Dhanishta and Satabhisha.

<p> The number of benefic units for agreement is 6.

<p> Example: - Mrigasira comes under Deva Gana while Dhanishta
comes under Rakshasa. Hence, Gana Kuta is absent.

<p> If the asterism of the bride is beyond the 14th from that of
the bridegroom the evil may be ignored.

<p> 3. Mahendra. - The constellation of the boy counted from that
of the girl should be the 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 22nd
or 25th. This promotes well-being and increases longevity.

<p> Example: - Mrigasira (constellation of the boy) is the 10th
from DhanisnTa (girl's constellation). Hence good.

<p> 4. Stree-Deergha. - The boy's constellation should preferably
be beyond the 9th from that of the girl. According to some
authorities the distance should be more than 7 constellations.

<p> Exception: - This consideration may be ignored if Rasi Kuta and
Graha Maitri obtain.

<p> Example: - Mrigasira is beyond 9 constellations from Dhanishta.
Hence agreement in regard to Stree-Deergha is present.

<p> 5. Yoni Kuta. - Yoni means sex and by Yoni Kuta is implied
sexual compatibility. The sexual urge of a person born for
instance in Chitta is supposed to be as strong as that of a
tiger. The human embryo in course of its development passes
through the various stages of evolution - mammals, quadrupeds,
etc., so that the tendencies of certain animals will be
predominant The birth constellation seems to show this
predominance. Each sign and degree of the zodiac expresses the
degree of evolution of the individual concerned. Thus, one born
in Leo will have in him the characteristics of a lion while the
other born in Aries will be timid and mild. It is these
biological influences that seem to be at the root of all
astrological considerations. If both the couple belong to the
male constellations, there will be frequent quarrels and want of
agreement in sex-matters. So the best way is to mate a male
belonging to a male constellation with a female belonging to a
female constellation. The Kutas in general lay down the
foundation for marriage happiness.

<p> Therefore the Yoni Kuta takes into account the sexual aspect of
marriage and indicates the sex affinities such as the degree of
sex-urge, sex-compatibility, the size of copulatory organs and
so on. Havelock Ellis says that "out of 500 consecutive cases
coming for advice (1930) all but one showed sexual maladjustment
as. a complicating factor". This reveals to us the importance of
Yoni Kuta. All the 27 constellations have been assigned certain
animals and sexes as given below: -

<pre>
   Male           Female         Class of Yoni

1  Aswini         Satabhisha     Horse
2  Bharani        Revati         Elephant
3  Pushya         Krittika       Sheep
4  Rohini         Mrigasira      Serpent
5  Moola          Aridra         Dog
6  Aslesha        Punarvasu      Cat
7  Makha          Pubba          Rat
8  Uttara         Uttarabhadra   Cow
9  Swati          Hasta          Buffalo
10 Visakha        China          Tiger
11 Jyeshta        Anuradha       Hare
12 Poorvashadha   Sravana        Monkey
13 Poorvabhadra   Danishta       Lion
14 Uttarashadha   Mongoose
</pre>

<p> Marriage between the constellations indicating same class of
yoni and between the male and female stars of that yoni said to
conduce to great happiness, perfect harmony and progeny. If the
male and female happen to be born in friendly yonis, but both
representing female constellations there will be fair happines
and agreement. If the couple belong both to male constellations
there will be constant quarrels and unhappiness. If marriage
takes place between constellations indicating unfriendly yonis
it is better marriage is avoided. For example, if marriage takes
place between a male born in Moola and female born in Aridra it
wiil turn out a very happy. The constellations Moola and Aridra
represent the male and female organs of a dog. The union of
these is agreeable and conduces to favourable results to the
fullest extent. If marriage takes place between a man born in
the constellation Satabhisha and a girl born in Punarvasu, both
representing the female stars, the marriage is passable but not
so good as in the first instance. Marriages between parsons
belonging to constellations indicating inimical yonis are not
recommended. The number of units for Yoni Kuta is 4.

<p> Example: - Both Mrigasira and Dhanishta arc female
constellations, the one typifying the yoni of a serpent and the
other that of a lion. Hence, Yoni Kuta is not present.

<p> The following pairs are hostile and in matching Yoni Kuta, they
should be avoided: -

<p> Cow and tiger; elephant and lion; horse and buffalo; dog and
hare; serpent and mongoose; monkey and goat; and cat and rat. In
a similar way, similar pairs of constellations typifying other
hostile pairs as they occur in nature should be avoided (see
Table on page 72).

<p> In the following table, units for matching different Yonis are
given. Suppose the boy's star is Krrttika signifying the Yoni of
sheep and the girl's star is Chitta signifying tiger. In the
column "sheep" running down our eye in the horizontal column
against tiger, the unit of agreements is I.

</pre>

<p> 6. Rasi Kuta. - lf the Rasi of the boy happens to be the 2nd
from that of the girl and if the Rasi of the girl happens to be
the 12th from that of the boy, evil results will follow. But if,
on the other hand, the Rasi of the boy falls in the 12th from
the girl's or the Rasi of the girl is in the 2nd from that of
the boy astrology predicts longevity for the couple. If the Rasi
of the boy is the 3rd from that of the girl. there will be
misery and sorrow. But if the Rasi of the girl is the 3rd from
that of the boy, there will be happiness. If the boy's falls in
the 4th from that of the girl's, then there will be great
poverty; but if the. Rasi of the girl happens to fall in the 4th
from the boy's there will be great wealth. If the boy's Rasi
falls in the 5th from that of the girl, there will be
unhappiness. But if the girl's Rasi falls in the 5th from that
of the boy, there will be enjoyment and prosperity. But where
the Rasis of the boy and the girl are in the 7th houses
mutually, then there will be health, agreement and happiness. If
the boy's Rasi falls in the 6th from the girl's there will be
loss of children, but if the girl's is the 6th from the boy's,
then the progeny will prosper.

<p> The number of units for Rasi Kuta is 7.

<p> Exception: - When both the Rasis are owned by one planet or if
the lords of the two Rasis happen to be friends, the evil
attributed above to the inauspicious disposition of Rasis gets
cancelled.

<p> 7. Rasyadhipathi or Graha Maitram. - This is the most important
Kuta inasmuch as it deals with the psychological dispositions of
the Couple. The mental qualities of the parties and their
affection for each other are admittedly of vital importance to
their happiness. This must be tested before marriage. In
Considering Graha Maitram the friendship or otherwise between
the lords of the Janma Rasis of the persons concerned is very
important. Planetary friendships are given in almost all
astrological works. But still I give below a table indicating
the relations between the different planets so that the reader
may not have to refer to other books.

<pre>
          Planetary Friendships
          Friend               Neutral           Enemy

The Sun   Moon, Mars, Jupiter  Mercury           Saturn, Venus

The Moon  Sun, Mercury         Mars, Jupiter
                               Venus, Saturn

Mars      Sun, Moon, Jupiter   Venus, Saturn     Mercury

Mercury   Sun, Venus           Mars, Jupiter,    Moon
                               Saturn

Jupiter   Sun, Moon, Mars      Saturn            Mercury, Venus

Venus     Mercury, Saturn      Mars, Jupiter     Sun, Moon

Saturn    Mercury, Venus       Jupiter           Sun, Moon, Mars
</pre>

<p> Some suggest that in considering the planetary relations, the
temporary dispositions should also be taken into account. This
in my humble opinion is not necessary, because, the entire
subject of adaptability hinges on the birth constellations and
not on birth charts as a whole.

<p> When the lords of the Janma Rasis of the bride and bridegroom
are friends, the Rasi Kuta is said to obtain in full. When one
is a friend and the other is a neutral, it is passable. When
both are neutral. Rasi Kuta is very ordinary. When both are
enemies, Rasi Kuta does not exist.

<p> Exception: - Even when there is no friendship between the Janma
Rasi lords of the bridegroom and bride, Rasi Kuta may be said to
exist if friendship prevails between the planets owning the
Navamsas occupied by the Moon.

<p> The number of units for this Kuta is 5.

<p> Example: - ln our illustration, the Janma Rasi lords are Venus
and Saturn. Both are friends. Therefore Rasi Kuta is complete.
Supposing the bride and bridegroom are born in Makha 2 (Leo) and
Satabhisha 2 (Saturn). The lords will be the Sun and Saturn
respectively and they are not friends. In such a case if the
Navamsa relationship is Considered, then the Moon will be in
Taurus (Venus) and Capricorn (Saturn) respectively. Venus and
Saturn, are friends and therefore the match is permissible. One
will have to be very careful in the assessment of these factors
and on superficial grounds no horoscope should be rejected as
unsuitable or unfortunate.

<p> 8. Vasya Kuta. - This is important as suggesting the degree of
magnetic control or amenability the wife or husband would be
able to exercise on the other. For Aries - Leo and Scorpio are
amenable. For Taurus - Cancer and Libra; for Gemini - Virgo; for
Cancer - Scorpo and Sagittarius; for Leo - Libra; for Virgo -
Pisces and Gemini; for Libra - Capricorn and Virgo; for Scorpio
- Cancer; for Sagittarius - Pisces; for Capricorn - Aries and
Aquarius; for Aquarius - Aries; arid for Pisces - Capricorn. The
unit of agreement is 2.

<p> Example: - ln our illustration, neither the boy's nor the
girl's horoscope is subject to the control of the other.

<p> 9. Rajju. - This indicates the strength or duration of married
life and therefore it merits special attention. The 27
constellations have been grouped into five types of Rajju.

<p> Padarajju. - Aswini, Aslesha, Makha, Jyeshta. Moola. Revati.

<p> Katirajju. - Bharani, Pushyami, Pubba, Anuradha, Poorvashadha,
Uttarabhadra.

<p> Nabhi or Udararajju. - Krittika, Punarvasu, Uttara, Visakha,
Uttarashadha, Poorvabhadra.

<p> Kantarajju. - Rohini, Aridra Hasta. Swati. Sravana, and
Satabhisha.

<p> Sirorajju. - Dhanishta, Chitta and Mrigasira.

<p> The Janma Nakshatras of the couple should not fall in the same
rajju. If they fall in Sira (head) husband's death is likely; if
in Kantha (neck) the wife may die; if in Udara (stomach) the
children may die; if in KatI (waist) poverty may ensue; and if
in Pada (foot) the couple may be always wandering. Hence, it is
desirable that the boy and the girl have constellations
belonging to different rajjus or groups.

<p> 10. Vedha. - This means affliction. Certain constellations are
capable of affecting or afflicting certain other constellations
situated at particular distances from them; For instance, Aswini
is said to cause Vedha to 18th constellation (viz., Jyeshta)
from it; Bharani to the 16th (viz., Anuradha) and so on. The
following pairs of constellations affect each other and,
therefore, no marriage should be brought about between a boy and
girl whos Janma Nakshatras belong to the same pair unless the
are other relieving factors.

<p> Aswini and Jyeshta; Bharani and Anuradha; Krittika and Visakha;
Rohini and Swati; Aridra and Sravana Punarvasu and Uttarashadha;
Pusayami and Poorvashadha; Aslesha and Moola; Makha and Revati;
Pubba and Uttarabhadra; Uttara and Poorvabhadra; Hasta and
Satabhisha, Mrigasira and Dhanishta. In our example, the
constellations of the couple (Mrigasira and Dhanishta) belong to
the prohibited pair and hence Vedhakuta is absent.

<p> 11. Varna. - This seems to signify the degree of spiritual or
ego development of the marrying partners. Pisces, Scorpio and
Cancer represent the highest development - Brahmin; Leo,
Sagittarius and Libra indicate the second grade - or Kshatriya;
Aries, Gemini and Aquarius suggest the third or the Vaisya;
while Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn indicate the last grade, viz.,
Sudra. A girl belonging fo a higher grade of spiritual
development should not be mated to a boy of lesser development.
The vice verse or both belonging to the same grade or degree is
allowed.

<p> The unit of agreement is 1.

<p> 12. Nadi Kuta. - This is considered to be the most important
and at the same time the most significant Kuta. In Sanskrit,
Nadi means several things but in reference to astrology, it
signifies pulse or nervous energy indicating the physiological
and to a certain extent hereditary factors. The Hindu medical
works enumerate three Nadis or humours, viz., Vatha (wind),
Pitha (bile) and Sleshma (phlegm). A boy with a predominantly
windy or phlegmatic or bilious constitution should not marry a
girl of the same type. The girl should belong to a different
temperament. The three Nadis are ruled by the different
constellations as follows: -

<pre>
Vata          Pitha         Sleshma
Aswini        Bharani       Krittika
Aridra        Mrigasira     Rohini
Punarvasu     Pushyami      Aslesha
Uttara        Pubba         Makha
Hasta         Chitta        Swati
Jyeshta       Anuradha      Visakha
Moola         Poorvashadha  Uttarasnadha
Satabhisha    Dhanishta     Sravana
Poorvabhadra  Uttarabhadra  Revati
</pre>

<p> If the constellation of the boy and girl fall in different
rows, then agreement between the couple will be good. They
should not fall in the middle. Stars of the couple may fall in
the first and the last line undercertain circumstances.

<p> If Nadi Kuta is not present on the basis of the Nakshatras,
then the same may be reckoned taking into account the Nakshatra
Padas. Thus, the different quarters will be governed by the
three humours (Nadis) thus:

<pre>
  Aswini 1    Aswini 2    Aswini 3
  Bharani 2   Bharani 1   Aswini 4
  Bharani 3   Bharani 4   Krittika 1
  Krittika 4  Krittika 3  Krittika 2
  Rohini 1    Rohini 2    Rohini 3
</pre>

<p> Beginning from Aswini 1, the counting should be done forwards
and backwards in threes as given above.

<p> The unit ascribed for this Kuta is 8.

<p> In the example considered above, both the constellations fall
in the middle line and hence Nadi Kuta is completely absent.

<p> Appendix 1 gives a table for measuring the agreement units. In
the first column (longitudinal) the constellations of the bride
are given.

<p> In the first horizontal column, the boy's nakshatra is given.
Take the figure in the column where the girl's and the boy's
stars interesect. Suppose the boy's star is Mrigasira 1, the
Rasi being Taurus.

<p> The girl's star is Satabhisha 2, Rasi being Kumbha. Running
down our eye from Taurus, Mrigasira 2 (horizontal first column)
to the horizontal line of Satabhisha 4, Kumbha. we find the
figure 26.5 as the total units of agreement.

<h3>Special Considerations</h3>

<p> We have dealt with above, fairly exhaustively, the question of
marriage adaptability and the importance of the various Kutas or
physiological and psychological junctions in the human body and
how a consideration of each Kuta would enable us to appreciate
the harmony or discord likely to prevail between intending
marriage partners.

<h3>Exceptions</h3>

<p> We shall now give certain contingencies arising by virtue of
common Janma Rasi, common birth star and the absence of certain
Kutas.

<p> (1) The absence of Stree-Deerga may be ignored if Rasi Kuta add
Graha Maitri are present.

<p> (2) If the Rasi of the girl is odd, the 6th and 8th Rasis
therefrom are friendly. If the Rasi of the girl is even the 2nd
and 12th therefrom become friendly. The evil due to the birth of
the bride in a Rakshasa gana star may be ignored if Janma Rasi
being 2nd and 12th, 9th and 5th or 6th and 8th, the lords of the
Rasis are the same or are mutual friends.

<p> (3) Though Graha Maitri is by far the most important, it need
not be considered if the couple have their Janma Rasis disposed
in one and seven from each other.

<p> (4) Rajju Kuta need not be considered in case Graha Maitri,
Rasi, Dina and Mahendra Kutas are present.

<p> (5) The evil due to Nadi Kuta can be ignored subject to the
following conditions: -

<p> (a) The Rasi and Rajju Kuta prevail, (b) The same planet is
lord of the Janma Rasis of both the mate and the female, (c) The
lords of ine Janma Rasis of the couple are friends.

<p> In many cases, the Janma Rasis of the Janma Nakshatras of the
bride and bridegroom would be the same. Special attention is
paid by astrological writers to such exceptions and we shall
throw some light on them for the edification of our readers.

<p> Common Janma Rasi. - Views differ as regards the results
accruing from the Janma Rasis being common. According to
Narada, common Janma Rasi would be conducive to the couple
provided they are born in different constellations. Garga
opines.that under the above circumstance, the asterism of the
boy should precede that of the girl if the marriage is to prove
happy. Incase the reverse holds good (Stree-purva). i. e., the
constellation of the girl precedes that of the boy, the alliance
should be rejected. This view is supported by other sages, viz..
Brihaspathi and Bhrigu. In fact, the author of Muhurtha Thathwa
goes to the extent of saying that in cases of common Janma Rasi,
provided the man's constellation is preceding the girl's, the
Kutas or adaptability need not be applied at all.

<p> Common Janma Nakshatra. - This is a further extension of the
principle of common Janma Rasi. The Janma Nakshatras of the
bride and bridegroom, being one and the same, are approved in
case of Rohini, Aridra, Makha, Hasta, Visakha, Sravana.
Uttarabhadra and Revati. The effect would bef ordinary if the
common Janma Nakshatras are Aswini, Krittika, Mrigasira,
Punarvasu, Pushya, Pubba. Uttara. Chitta, Anuradha, Poorvashadha
and Uttarashadha, Bharani, Aslesha. Swati, Jyeshta, Moola,
Dhanishta, Satabhisha and Poorvabhadra happening to be common
Janma Nakshatras are not recommended.

<p> Here again certain ancient authors hold that even though the
Janma Nakshatras are same, the evil becomes nullified if the
Padas are different. If the Janma Nakshatra belongs to two signs
(e.g., Krittika) the Pada of the bride should relate to the
preceding sign. For example, if Krittika is the common Janma
Nakshatra, the bride should have her Janma Rasi in Mesha and the
bridegroom in Vrishabha. If, however, the common Janma Nakshatra
belongs to two signs equally (e.g., Mrigasira, Chitta, etc.) the
sign for the first two quarters should be that of the
bridegroom.

<p> The couple should not have the same Janma Rasi, same Janma
Nakshatra and Pada. However, in regard to Satabhisha, Hasta,
Swati. Aswini, Krittika, Poorvashadha, Mrigasira and Makha, the
evil given rise to by virtue of common Janma Rasi, Nakshatra and
Pada gets cancelled if the couple are born in the first quarter.

<h3>Destructive Constellations</h3>

<p> There is a belief current amongst the public that girls born in
certain constellations cause the death of certain relatives. For
instance, a girl born in Visakha is said to bring about the
destruction of her husband's younger brother so that parents
generally try to find out a bridegroom who does not have a
younger brother. Even when there are other merits in the
horoscope, it is rejected on the simple ground that the girl is
born in Visakha. This is entirely due to ignorance of the real
astrological factors governing such considerations. Only certain
Padas or quarters should be held inauspicious and not the entire
constellation. Thus, in regard to Visakha, only the last quarter
is evil and not the first three. Therefore a girl born in the
first three quarters of Visakha should not be considered to
bring misfortune to her husband's younger brother. Similarly,
the boy or girl born in the first quarter of Moola is to be
rejected as it is said to cause the death of the father-in-law.
The last three quarters of Moola are beneficial. A girl born in
Jyeshta is said to cause evil to her husband's elder brother.
Almost all authors agree that (certain parts of) Moola, Astesha,
Jyeshta and Visakha are destructive constellations - Moola
(first quarter) for husband's father; Aslesha (first quarter)
for husband's mother; Jyeshta (first quarter) for girl's
husband's elder brother; and Visakha (last quarter) for
husband's younger brother.*

<h3>The So-called Kuja Dosha</h3>

<p> The position of Venus and Mars is very important in judging
marital relations. Mars whose element is fire rules marriage.
Where he is badly situated or associated in the horoscope of a
male or female, it follows that the sacerdotal fire gets
extinguished soon. Such unfavourable situation goes under the
name of Kuja Dosha.

<p> It must be noted that in determining marriage adaptability
between two parties, there are several elements of much more
importance than Kuja Dosha. And the evil influences accuring
from the bad position of Mars is only one of the several
elements.

<p> It is unfortunate that throughout South India especially in the
Tamil areas, much is made of the so-called Kuja Dosham and this
bugbear has been the means of destroying the happiness of many
families by preventing marriages otherwise very eligible and
anxiously wished for. So far as our humble experience goes it is
only in the Kerala Sastra that mention is made of Kuja Dosha.
The stanza runs thus: Dhana vyayecha pathale jamitre chashtame
kuja; Strinam bharthru vinasamcha bharthunam strivinasanam. This
means: - "If Mars is in the 2nd, 12th, 4th, 7th and 8th houses
in the horoscope of the female, the death of the husband will
occur; similar situation in the husband's horoscope causes the
death of wife."

<p> The Lagna represents body, the Moon, mind and Venus, sexual
relations. Therefore, the houses have to be reckoned with
reference to all the three, viz., Lagna, Moon and Venus. The
dosha (evil) is considered weak when it exists from Lagna, a
little stronger from the Moon and still more powerful from
Venus.

<p> The second house signifies family; the twelth represents
comforts and pleasures of bed. The fourth rules sukha or
happiness. The seventh indicates husband and eighth represents
longevity of the wife or husband. Hence the position of Mars in
these houses is supposed to produce this peculiar dosham or
evil. If Kuja Dosham obtains in the horoscopes of both the bride
and bridegroom, the dosham gets cancelled. There are, of course,
many good combinations which assure marital felicity and much
importance need not be given to Kuja Dosham.

<p> Granting that Kuja Dosham is a factor whose occurrence should
not be ignored, there are antidotes which are not generally
known to the rank and file of Hindu astrologers. The exceptions
are: Mars in the 2nd can be said to be bad provided such 2nd
house is any other than Gemini and Virgo; in the 12th the dosha
is produced when such 12th house is any other than Taurus and
Libra in the 4th house Mars causes dosha provided the house
falls in any sign other than Aries and Scorpio; when the 7th is
other than Capricorn and Cancer, the dosha is given rise to; and
Mars gives bad effects in the 8th, provided the 8th is any other
than Sagittarius and Pisces. In Aquarius and Leo, Mars produces
no dosha whatsoever. The dosha is counteracted by the
conjunction of Mars and Jupiter or Mars and the Moon; or by the
presence of Jupiter or Venus in the ascendant.

<p> Thus, it will be seen that Kuja Dosha does not deserve that
consideration which is now being paid to it. In the
consideration of marriage adaptability there are various other
factors which should be carefully examined.

<p> We have dealt above fairly exhaustively with the question of
marriage adaptability and have tried to avoid controversial
issues as the book is intended for the common man who wishes to
take advantage of the astrological rules to his benefit.

<h3>Electing a Time for Marriage</h3>

<p>Ordinarily almost every Indian Panchanga gives important dates
and times for celebrating marriages. The reader cannot rely on
them as most of the dates given would not be free from important
flaws. Moreover, the marriage dates selected would generally be
in accordance with local usages. For instance, a Tamilian would
not mind marriage being performed in lunar month of Ashadha
(provided the Sun has not entered Cancer). But strong objection
is taken to this by people living in Andhra and Karnataka. Apart
from this, there is universal agreement all over India as
regards the time, weekday, constellation and planetary positions
to be obtained at the time of marriage.

<p> I am giving below the most standard methods employed by
scholars, warranted by experience and sanctioned by the ancient
sages.

<p> The lunar months of Magha, Phalguna, Vaisakha and Jyeshta are
good. Kartika and Margasira are ordinary. The rest are not
auspicious. Some sages opine that marriages can be celebrated in
Pushya and Chaitra provided the Sun is in Capricorn and Aries
respectively.

<p> The following lunar days, viz., from the 11th day (dark half)
to New Moon, Riktha Thithis, 8th, 12th and 6th should be
rejected. The best lunar days are the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th,
11th and 13th (of the bright half).

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the best. Sunday and
Saturday are middling. And Tuesday should be invariably
rejected.

<p> The best asterisms are Rohini, Mrigasira, Makha, Uttara, Hasta,
Swati, Anuradha, Moola, Uttarashadha, Uttarabhadra and Revati.
The first quarter of Makha and Moola and the last quarter of
Revati are inauspicious and they should be rejected.
Constellations not mentioned here are unsuitable and they should
be avoided.

<p> The following yogas should be rejected: Vyatipata, Dhruva,
Mrityu, Ganda, Vajra, Soola, Vishkambha, Atiganda, Vyaghata and
Parigha.

<p> Vishtikarana must invariably be discarded.

<p> Among the zodiacal signs Gemini, Virgo and Libra are the best.
Taurus, Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius and Aquarius are middling. The
rest are inauspicious.

<p> In the election of a Muhurtha for marriage, as many of the 21
doshas (already mentioned) as possible should be avoided. The
most important considerations however are (a) The 7th house must
be unoccupied by any planet, (b) Mars should not be in the 8th,
(c) Venus should not be in the 6th, {d) the Lagna should not be
hemmed in between malefics, (e) malefics should not occupy
Lagna. and (f) the Moon in the election chart should have no
association with any other planet.

<p> Apart from the above, the usual Tarabala, Panchaka. etc.,
should be looked into. Elsewhere are given certain special
combinations which are supposed to neutralise adverse influeces.
As far as possible, such combinations should be applied to
secure a really propitious moment. Jupiter, Mercury or Venus in
Lagna, malefics in the 3rd or 11th, would constitute a
formidable force in rendering the Lagna strong. The following
are some of the special combinations which are supposed to
fortify the marriage election chart: -

<p> (1) Jupiter in the ascendant, Venus in the 8th and the Sun in
the 11th - Mahendra Yoga.

<p> (2) Venus in Lagna. Jupiter in the 10th and the Sun and Mercury
in the 11th-Vishnu Priya Yoga.

<p> (3) Venus in the 2nd, Jupiter in the 12th, the Sun in the 8th
and Saturn in the 6th - Sreenatha Yoga.

<p> (4) Venus in Lagna, Jupiter in the 4th, Mercury in the 2nd and
Saturn in the 11th - Samudra Yoga.

<p> (5) Mercury, Jupiter and Venus in Lagna - Vijaya Yoga.

<p> (6) Venus and Jupiter in Lagna elevated or otherwise strong -
Jaya Yoga.

<p> (7) Saturn in the 3rd, Jupiter in the 6th, the Sun in the 10th
and Mars in the 11th - Pushya Yoga.

<p> (8) Mars in the 3rd, Saturn in the 6th, Venus in the 9th,
Jupiter in the 12th - Maharshi Yoga.

<p> (9) Venus in Lagna, Jupiter in the 11th - Ardhama Yoga.

<p> Thus, it will be seen that the Hindus have devised an
astrological means of judging marriage compatibility whereby the
relations between the couple may stand the strain of
maladjustment. If astrological advices are properly heeded to.
there will be fewer tragedies than at present and less marital
infidelity. Modern sexologists and sociologists will do well to
study the theory behind the astrological rules bearing on
marriage casting off their prejudices instead of criticising and
condemning the system.


<h2><a name=10>CHAPTER X<br>
Elections Concerning General Matters</a></h2>

<p> In this chapter, I propose to deal with such elections as have
a bearing on the personal life of an individual. For instance,
one has to buy or sell shares, buy or wear new clothes, etc.
Auspicious times could be fixed for all such important daily
activities.

<p> Wearing New Clothes. - Aswini. Rohini, Punarvasu, Pushyami,
Uttara, Hasta, Chitta, Swati, Visakha, Dhanishta and Revati are
the best. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are good.
Sunday is middling. Tuesday and Saturday are inauspicious. The
4th, 9th, 14th lunar days and New Moon day should be avoided.
The Moon should be as far as possible in good aspect to the Sun.

<p> Forming a Library. - Mercury should be in exaltation or occupy
the Lagna. Thursday is the best. Fortify Lagna by placing a
malefic in the 11th.

<p> Employ ing Servants. - Avoid Tuesdays and Saturdays. Look to
the strength of the 11th house lord. Saturn must be in the 11th
free from the aspect of Mars or Rahu.

<p> Make the lord of the sixth occupy the 11th and as far as
possible, choose a fixed sign. Afflictions to Mercury should
also be avoided as they bring about theft in the house.

<p> Shaving. - There are certain people who seem to be under the
delusion that the ancients were a set of fools and that their
observations of phenomena - in their various aspects - do not
merit the attention of the modern man. Many of the modern
scientific discoveries had been anticipated by the ancients.
Possessing a splendid language which stands unrivalled even to
this day in its powers of expression and brevity, they employed
Sanskrit words which embodied their scientific discoveries
unmistakably. Intellectual prejudices go a great deal to warp
the judgement of even the greatest men and some so-called men of
science have entirely fallen into this inviting snare. The
hair-spltting philosophers of the East, says the intellectual
upstart of the modern day, do not deserve the slightest
consideration for their scientific knowledge. The means by which
the ancient Maharshis pursued their intellectual studies are not
well known to us, but the fragments of literary and scientific
works left to us by the Rishis have their own intrinsic value.

<p> In the article entitled "Moon and Terrestrial Life, published
in the April 1943 issue of The Astrological Magazine, Mr. M. V.
Ramakrishnan has shown the periodicity existing between certain
happenings on terrestrial life and the lunar movements. The
following sentences which I am extracting from the article in
question are significant. "Persons who wish their hair to grow
dense and long should cut it in the first half of the Moon.
Nails should be cut at the waxing period to give them a good
chance of growing." Compare this with the principles given in
Muhurtha works especially regarding the injunctions pertaining
to shaving. People seem to laugh at the idea when astrologers
tell them that they should have this operation on particular
days at particular times.

<p> The science of electricity was known to the ancients and it was
the late Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao that was responsible for
bringing into light this important fact. The human body is a
bundle of electrical currents and the hairs and naits are
channels through which this electricity is discharged. With a
view to concentrate and preserve all good energies in man and to
dissipate and get rid of all evil forces in the human body, the
Maharshis have laid down certain rules, which when studied by
themselves look quite arbitrary and meaningless, but which when
carefully examined in the light of conservation of energy
principle look most wonderful and striking with regard to the
knowledge possessed by them in physical sciences.

<p> According to Maharshi Vatsyayana, akshi (eyes), vaksha (chest),
kukshi (stomach), sira (head), hridi (heart), hastam (hands),
apatsu (feminine sexual organ), nabhi (navel), medhra (male
sexual organ), adhobhaga nalayuha (lower intestines),
buddisthana (seat of intelligence of brain) and brahmadanda (the
seat of the ray of the-Brahma) are all seats of electricity.
Hence the cutting of hair from the head means so much loss of
vitality of the body. On certain lunar days owing to the nature
of the electrical energies coming from the Moon-such loss of
vitality from the body can be neutralised. Hence the injunction
that shaving should be had recourse to at such times as would
minimise or neutralise the flow of electric currents from these
sources.

<p> If a man shaves after food, he commits a great blunder as the
electrical currents from his body, which are about to be
discharged by the digestion of food, are harmfully interfered
with, and as a natural consequence his health may be affected in
course of time. Shaving means cutting off hair from some part of
the head and face and this again means loss of electricity which
is so very essential for the proper upkeep of the physical and
mental faculties of an individual.

<p> People inclined towards the practice of spiritual precepts
generally grow beards. The idea is to avoid waste of energy. Eye
defects, loss of memory, loss of sight, deafness and other
injurious consequences are directly traceabie to promiscuous
shaving without reference to day or time and many physical ills
of man may be minimised by regulating "Shaving" in the light of
astrological principles.

<p> Shaving may be had in the constellation of Pushya, Punarvasu,
Revat, Haste, Sravana, Dhanishta, Mrigasira, Aswini, Chitta,
Jyeshta, Satabhisha and Swati. 4th, 6th and 14th lunar days as
also New Moon and Full Moon days are not desirable. Similar
considerations have held good in the matter of death and birth
pollution and solar and lunar eclipses. The ancients studied
sciences and laid down strict injunctions so that humanity may
be benefited. They did not believe in simply cataloguing facts
as we in modern times do. These may be sour grapes for those who
are blinded by thick prejudices but they are sweet for those who
have a clear mental vision and who wish to economise the waste
of spiritual energy for their own ultimate good.

<p> Cutting Nails. - Avoid Fridays and Saturdays - the 8th, 9th,
14th lunar days as well as New and Full Moon days. Cutting nails
means discharge of electricity from the human body and one
should be careful to see that the reaction on the human body is
not adverse.

<p> Buying Utensils, etc. - Place Jupiter in good aspect to the
Moon while buying brass vessels; to Mars when buying vessels of
copper; to Saturn if steel and iron; to ascendant if of silver.
Avoid the asterisms of Aslesha. Moola and Jyeshta. For buying
tools, similarly avoid the 8th and 9th lunar days and New Moon.

<p> Buying Jewellery. - The Sun and the Moon should be well
situated and aspected. As usual unfavourable lunar days and
asterisms should be avoided.

<p> Landing Money. - One should not lend money on days ruled by
Krittika, Makha, Moola, Satabhisha, Uttara, Punarvasu or one's
Janma Nakshatra day. One should try to receive money on these
days. Tuesdays and Fridays are also inauspicious. Never lend
money on a New Moon day happening to be Saturday. The lords of
the ascendant and the 7th should be harmoniously disposed. The
Moon's situation In Scorpio is bad for the lender.

<p> Borrowing Money. - Do not borrow money on days ruled by
Krittika, Moola, Punarvasu, Dhanishta and Janma Nakshatra.
Moon's conjunction with Mars and Saturn shouid be avoided as
otherwise there will be quarrels and litigation. If the money is
intended for quick use on domestic or personal matters, the.
Moon should be in good aspect to the ascendant. If the borrowed
money is to be spent on business the Moon must be in a
favourable situation with regard to Mercury and lord of Lagna.
For any election, purity of lunar day, weekday, any
constellation and Tarabala are essential and further
considerations come in only later on.

<p> Buying for Business. - Thursday, the 10th lunar day and the
constellation of Pushyami are the best. Tuesday should be
completely rejected. Saturday is passable. Mercury, the 2nd
lord and the 2nd house should all be fortified. Avoid buying for
trade when Mercury is afflicted by Mars as this will destroy
stocks and cause discord and wrangling. Mercury and Jupiter in
conjunction in Lagna or in mutual aspects would be highly
propitious.

<p> Buying Cattle. - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday are
good. The lord of the day in question should occupy the rising
sign at the time of transaction. To buy sheep the propitoius
time is that on a Thursday ruled by Pushya when Aries is rising.

<p> Selling for Profit. - Let the Moon and Mercury be free from the
conjunction or aspect of Mars. The Moon's situation in Taurus.
Cancer or Pisces would greatly help the seller. Try to keep
Mercury in a kendra from Lagna or at least in good aspect to
Jupiter. Tuesday should be avoided. Monday, Wednesday and
Thursday are the best. While Friday is unpropitious, Saturday is
middling.

<p> Shifting from Place to Place. More details are given in Chapter
XIII. If one is to move urgently from one place to another.
Janma Nakshatra should be avoided. Anuradha, Mrigasira and
Hasta are the best. Journey on the 9th lunar day is prohibited.
Yet in cases of urgency, one can move at a propitious moment. If
you desire pecuniary gain conform to all the astrological
requirements suggested in Chapter XIV. In any case, let there be
Tarabala and Chandrabala and let the ascendant be fortified. The
Moon and the ascendant should both be in fixed signs. Jupiter or
Venus should be in an angle preferably in the ascendant or the
10th.

<p> Recovering Money Dua. - The lord of Lagna should be strong and
the election rising sign should not fall in the 8th or 9th from
the radical rising sign. The lords of Lagna and the 2nd must
also be well situated.

<p> Pledging. - Articles pledged under Visakha, Krittika (Sadhana),
Bharani, Makha, Pubba, Poorvashadha, Poorvabhadra (Vajra),
Aridra, Aslesha, Jyeshta arid Moola (Theeshana) do not return.
Jupiter and the Moon should be mutually well disposed. Tuesdays
and Fridays are inauspicious as also lunar days declared
generally evil.

<p> Making a Will. - The Moon, the Lagna and the lord of the Lagna
should all be in fixed signs. The constellation of Pushyami is
the best as also Wednesday and Thursday - Tuesday and Friday
should be avoided. For the benefit of the legatee, the rising
sign should be one of Jupiter or Venus. Let Mars and Saturn be
in the 3rd or 11th house. The 8th house must also be rendered
strong as otherwise the testator will die.


<h2><a name=11>CHAPTER XI<br>
Elections Pertaining to Education</a></h2>

<p> According to ancient sages Vidya or Education comprises the
study of the Vedas, Vedangas, Mimamsa, Dharmasastras, Medicine,
Music, Political Sciences and Economic subjects. Elaborate
treatises exist on all these subjects. In order to get
proficiency in the different branches of knowledge, education
should be commenced under auspicious planetary influences. Each
subject in which mastery is desired calls for concentration-to
be applied in a particular form with a view to tapping the
intellectual resources of the particular type-latent in the
brain cells. Astrological consultation is held to facilitate
such concentration as the moment selected for commencing the
study of a particular subject is supposed to tune the mental
currents to be in harmony with the natural forces.

<p> The most beneficial constellations for commencing education are
Mrigasira, Aridra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Hasta, Chitta, Swat},
Sravana, Dhanishta and Satabhisha. Aswini is held by some
writers to be one of the best. Rohini, Uttara, Uttarashadha and
Revati are neutral. The remaining ones are to be rejected.

<p> Tuesday and Saturday should invariably be avoided. Sunday can
be considered permissible if other atrological conditions are
satisfactory. The following lunar - days are auspicious: - 1st
(of dark half), 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 10th and 11th. The 4th, 8th,
9th, 14th and New and Full Moon days should be avoided.

<p> The Lagna should not be a fixed sign. Common signs are the best
and the movable ones ordinary.

<p> In commencing education - be it of any type - one should have
regard to two important Yogas given below: -

<p>Saraswati Yoga -

<p> (a) Wednesday coinciding with Hasta, the rising sign at the
time being Gemini or Virgo with the Sun, Moon and Mercery
occupying the Amsa of Mercury.

<p> (b) Wednesday at sunrise when Mercury is in deep exaltation.

<p> (c) Wednesday, when Mercury is in Lagna and occupies the 3rd
quarter of Hasta.

<p> (d) Jupiter in deep exaltation in Lagna on days other than
Saturday and Sunday.

<p> Vidya Yoga -

<p> (a) Friday when Pisces is rising and Venus occupies the 27th
degree of the same sign.

<p> (b) Jupiter in deep exaltation and Cancer rising on Thursday.

<p> (c) The day and constellation being propitious, the Sun must be
placed in his own Hora.

<p> If education were to progress satisfactorily, one must have due
regard to the following considerations also.

<p> The forenoon and the noon are the best. Malefics should be
disposed in die 3rd, 6th and 11th houses. The 8th house should
be clean and unoccupied by benefic or malefic planets. For
starting education, Wednesday morning would be the befit
provided the election chart is otherwise well disposed and
strong.

<p> Learning Vedas and Sasrras. - Pushyami, Dhanishta and Sravana
are auspicious ones. Let Jupiter be as strong as possible.

<p> Learning Astrology and Astronomy. - Aswini, Punarvasu,
Pushyami, Hasta, Swati, Moola and Revati are good.

<p> Learning Grammar. Logic and Philosophy. - Rohini, Mrigasira,
Punarvasu, Pushya, Hasta, Dhanishta and Revati are favourable
constellations for learning Grammar while for the other subjects
Sravana, Satabhisha, Hasta, Uttara, Moola and Revati are good.
The intellectual planet Mercury should be fortified as usual.

<p> Learning Medicine. - Dhanishta is the best constellation not
only for beginning the study of medicine but also for learning
the use of firearms. An affliction to Mars by Saturn should be
avoided. Let the rising sign or Navamsa be that of Mars or the
Sun.

<p> To Learn Music and Dancing. - Let Venus be as strongly placed
as possible avoiding affliction by Rahu or Saturn, as this is
said to lead to an immoral career. Hasta, Pushyami, Dhanishta,
Anuradha, Jyeshta, Revati, Satabhisha, Uttarashadha and
Uttarabhadra are the best. Harmonious aspects should exist
between Jupiter and Venus. Place the lord of Lagna in the 5th or
9th and see that these two houses are free from affliction.
Mercury-Venus conjunction in Lagna would be highly propitious.

<p> Learning any Science. - The Study of any science can be
commenced either in a Saraswati Yoga or in a Vidya Yoga under
any of the special combinations mentioned above.

<p> Learning a Trade. - The planet ruling the avocation should be
well disposed in regard to the ascendant and free from
affliction. The following are the occupations governed by the
different planets.

<p> The SUN denotes kings, members of political department,
ministers, magistrates, lawyers and civil servants. The Sun
favourably situated in relation to the 10th house bestows
professions of the above nature. The MOON rules over nurses,
midwives, jewellers, dealers in pearls and precious metals, and
also governmental activities. MARS produces soldiers, warriors,
carpenters, mechanics, surveyors, chemists, bankers, commanders,
insurance agents, and butchers. MERCURY gives rise to preceptors
or school masters, mathematicians, authors, printers,
secretaries, book-sellers, accountants and insurance agents.
JUPITER makes one a priest, a lawyer, a councillor, judge,
scholar and a public man. VENUS produces artistes, musicians,
actors, perfumers, jewellers, winesellers and solicitors with a
keen intellect. SATURN governs different kinds of professions
involving responsibility and subordination, mill hands,
compositors, hawkers, factory workers, scavengers and manual
workers in general.

<p> The planet in question may also occupy the 10th house aspected
by benefics. Tuesday must be avoided for learning any trade.


<h2><a name=12>CHAPTER XII<br>
House Building</a></h2>

<p> The instinct to possess a house is to be found not only in man,
the acme of creation, but throughout the animal kingdom. The
cells of bee's honey-comb are models of economy and mathematical
skill while the ant-hills are noted for their strength. Man
cannot be an exception to this primary instinct. Unfortunately,
man, due to pride and arrogance, fails to give the thought and
attention due to astrological factors which are as important as
the selection of a site or planning of the building.

<p> In Sanskrit, house-building goes under the name of Vastu
Shastra and a lot of useful literature composed by great sages
are extant on this most important subject. It must be within
the experience of a number of persons that in spite of the best
engineering skill displayed in the construction of a house, it
would sometimes be lacking what is usually termed the 'charm'
with the result the builder does not feel really happy at all.
In India at least mere external appearance, however attiiactive.
does not give the owner the mental satisfaction that a man Of
slender means enjoys when the house is built in confofmity wrth
astrological canons. So strong is the sentiment that even the
most educated and "cultured" modern man would not afford to take
risks in laying the foundation-stone or fixing the door-frame or
entering the house without reference to astrological factors.

<p> A house may look grand and attractive on the outside, may
command and may possess all the anpurtenances according to
sanitary principles. Here the external factors, which we shall
term the morphology of a house, are intact. But what about the
internal or psychological factors involved? Every object in
nature has the power of radiating cosmic force in some form or
other. The materials collected for building a structure and the
commencement of the structure itself involve the influx and
interaction of a series of such invisible forces that the time
selected should be capable of exerting forces harmonious to such
invisible radiations. The ancient Maharshis had realised the
importance of the interplay of such forces between objects in
nature and man, though, in recent times, it has fallen to the
lot of a Russian scientist and engineer, Georges Lakhovsky, to
demonstrate its reality.

<p> All objects in nature, whether mineral, vegetable or animal,
are produced and destroyed under the influence of the solar ray
and its various modifications. Many of the great buildings,
intended for the use of an individual, community or a nation,
have caused ruin to the parties concerned. It cannot be said
that those buildings which have inflicted loss or ruin to the
promoters of the schemes had no good engineering skill bestowed
on them. When large sums of money are spent on such
undertakings, it is natural to suppose that the best Intellects
in the field of engineering had been consulted and the greatest
care had been taken in collecting proper materials. If the best
heads and the best materials are used. it Is natural to suppose
that the results would also be most satisfactory.

<p> On the contrary, we find that some buildings are spared the
ruthless hands of time, some others crash very soon; some bring
prosperity to the owner while some bring about unhappiness,
misery and ultimate destruction. It cannot be an accident that
while some buildings are spared the ruthless hands of wild
conquerors, others close to them, or forming part and parcel of
them, get destroyed under exceptional circumstances. There must
surely be some reason for these variations in the ups and downs
in the life of a building. The causes for these have to be
searched far behind the superficial strata of argument and
ordinary conception. The explanation is to be found in the great
works on astrology composed by the sages.

<p> If a construction is begun at a time when the strength of the
materials is found in plenty - which can be ascertained by the
rules of astrology, when the influences which work against the
forces of cohesion; adhesion and chemical combination, etc., are
counteracted by zodiacal and stellar influences, when the
magnetic currents are favourable to the union and permanency of
the materials, it is said to prosper long.

<p> There is an important branch of astrology dealing with this
absorbing subject under the name of Vastu Sastra and its study
is very material to the securing of permanency and prosperity,
to the buildings constructed. The mysterious influence of time
(Kalapurusha) is well marked. It accounts for the neglect or
care of these buildings, their dilapidation or freshness, their
occupation by men in power or by owls and other birds of
illomen, their being covered up by mounds of earth or sand, and
discovered after a long series of future generations to furnish
facts and evidences for civilization which have disappeared, for
societies which have passed away and for knowledge of
construction which was concealed in the Little Heads which
planned their commencement.

<p> The combinations of planets at the time of commencement, the
position and strength of constellation, the waning and waxing of
the ever unsteady Moon, the rising or sinking of the principal
designer, and the Luck of the party, who first lays the
foundation-stone, hate their own influence 10 exert.

<p> The animal magnetism of the principle man has much to do with
the prosperity of the edifice and also his heart and soul with
reference to community who are to be profited by the
construction. It is not astrology and sheer superstition when a
lucky king or governor or president is asked to open an
institution, to unveil a statue, to lay the foundation-stone for
large buildings, and dig but a bit of earth for the success of
the undertaking? These are the legitimate works of the humblest
coolies, and if astrology has no hold, if influence of Luck has
no place, why on earth do the most enlightened nations invite
the luckiest man to open such proceedings?

<p> Laying stones or digging the earth is not the legitimate
function of any so-called big man. On the other hand, it belongs
to the ordinary labourer who is present on the spot. If the most
civilised nations of the earth do not believe in such Nonsense
as luck and astrology let them not be making themselves fools by
resorting to such stupid ceremonies.

<p> People are not frank. They do one thing and preach another. It
is better that if they have no belief at all in the science of
astrology they may not enact "tom fooleries" on ignorant and
superstitious humanity.

<p> The Muhurtham refers to auspicious combination of various
planetary influences, and the Worship offered during such
occasions before the work is commenced. has special reference
to the ave ting of 'evils' which may be in store for the
Buildings under question.

<p> Astrology, as applied to engineering, goes under the special
name of Vastu Sastra and merits deep study and understanding by
modern engineers.

<p> The construction of a house according to astrological works
involves four important stages, viz., (1) Laying the foundation,
(2) Digging the well, (3) Fixing the door-frames, and (4) Entry
into the new house. Of the four stages, the first and the last
are very important and significant.

<p> Laying the Foundation. - According to ancient astrological
savants just as Kalapurusha personifies Time, Vastu Purusha
personifies the House. The Vastu Purusha is said to sleep on his
left with his head to the East during the months of Bhadrapada,
Aswayuja and Kartika (August to October); with his head to the
South during Margasira. Pushya and Magha (November to February);
with his head to the West during.Phalguna, Chaitra and Vaisakha
(February to May) and with his head to the North during Jyeshta,
Ashadha and Sravana (May to August). No building should be
erected on the ground covered by his head, his legs, his hands
and his back. as it is said to prove fatal to the father, wife
and children respectively and cause fear of thieves. The most
suitable section would be the ground covered by the stomach of
Vastu Purusha as it gives rise to plenty and prosperity.

<p> No house-building should be commenced in the lunar months of
Jyeshta, Ashadha, Bhadrapada, Aswayuja, Margasira, Pushya and
Phalguna as they connote respectively death, destruction,
disease, quarrels and misunderstandings, loss of wealth,
incendiarism and physical danger The lunar months of Chaitra,
Vaisakha, Sravana, Kartika and Magha are the best. The Sun
should occupy fixed signs or at least movable signs but no
building work should be undertaken when the Sun is in common
signs.

<p> Rohirii, Mrigasira, Chitta, Hasta, Jyeshta, Uttara,
Uttarashadha and Sravana are the best constellations to lay the
foundation,

<p> Swati, Pushya, Anuradha, Aswini, Satabhisha, Uttarabhadra and
Revati are ordinary or middling while the remaining twelve
asterisms should invariably be avoided.

<p> All odd tithis (lunar days) except the 9th are good. Of the
even tithis the 2nd, 6th and 10th are auspicious. Monday,
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the best, Even Monday should
be rejected when the Moon is waning. Sunday and Saturday are
approved by some but in our opinion Saturday should be rejected
as it connots frequent thefts. Sunday should also be avoided
unless the day is otherwise very auspicious.

<p> Fixed signs are the best. Movable signs, should be rejected.
Common signs may he preferred provided they are occupied by
strong benefics. In movable signs and fixed navamsas can also be
considered in cases of urgency, subject to the satisfactory
disposition of other astrological factors. The rising sign, at
the time of laying the foundation should be highly fortified by
the disposition of malefics in 3rd, 6th and 11th houses and
benefics in kendras and trines. The 8th house should be vacant
and in no case should it have the aspect of malefic planet.

<p> The following are some of the special combinations recommended
as highly propitious by aincient astrological writers for laying
the foundation so that the house could last long and ensure
happiness and prosperity to the owner as well as the tenant.

<p> Foundation is to be laid in Cancer, the superstructure erected
in Gemini or Virgo and the roofing done in Taurus or Libra. The
house becomes, fire-proof. A house built when Jupiter or Venus
is in Lagna, end the Sun exactly on the meridian or at the
western horizon, is supposed to last for at least one hundred
years.

<p> When the 10th house is occupied by the Moon, the 4th by Jupiter
and the 11 th by Mars and Saturn, the house will remain
undestroyed for at least 80 years.

<p> Jupiter in Lagna, Mercury in the 7th, Saturn in the 3rd, the
Sun and Venus in the 6th, the house will stand for a century.

<p> Mercury occupying Lagna, Jupiter the 7th and the Moon the 10th
indicate similar stability.

<p> Varahamihira suggests that after finishing the puja, the first
foundation - stone shall be laid on the north-eastern corner of
the site.

<p> Fixing the Door - Frame. - The Hindus attach special
significance to the fixing of door-frames. Even today the
so-called educated man publicly scoffing at astrology stealthily
consults an astrologer in private, and gets an auspicious time
for fixing door-frames. Probably the door-frames have the
peculiarity of attracting the best electric and magnetic forces
from the atmosphere. Then fixed in auspicious times - times at
which the different planetary bodies would be so disposed as to
concentrate the maximum of benefic influence. The door-frame
should always be fixed at a time when the rising sign is a fixed
one. Rohini, Mrigasira, Uttara, Chitta, Anuradha, Uttarashadha,
Uttarabhadra and Revati may be elected. The tithi (lunar day),
asterism, the day and the rising sign should all be carefully
selected, for the moment of fixing the door-frame has an
important bearing upon the prosperity of the master. The doors,
etc., maybe furnished on Wednesday or Friday ruled by any
beneficial lunar day, a common sign and any of the following
constellations, viz., Aswini, Pushya, Nasta, Rohini, Uttara,
Uttarashadha and Uttarabhadra.

<p> The durability or duration of a dwelling house in a state of
prosperity should be determined from the moment at which the
foundation-stone is laid. Foundations laid under the following
combinations assure prosperity and a long life for the house to
be constructed.

<p> (1) From the Lagna, the Moon should be in the 10th; Jupiter in
the 14th and Mars and Saturn in the 11th. (2) Jupiter in Lagna,
Mercury in the 7th, Saturn in the 3rd, the Sun in the 6th and
Venus in the 4th. (3) The rising sign should be occupied by
Venus, the 10th house by Mercury, any kendra by Jupiter and the
11th by the Sun. (4) The Moon in the rising sign, Jupiter in the
7th and Mercury in the 10th. (5) Venus in the 10th, Jupiter in
the 7th and Mercury in Lagna - which should be a fixed sign. (6)
Jupiter in Lagna (fixed) Mercury in the 7th and the Moon in the
10th.

<p> Any of the above planetary positions at the moment of laying
the foundation will establish the building in prosperity for a
long number of years.

<p> Jupiter in combination with Rohini, Mrigasira, Aslesha, Uttara.
Poorvashadha, Uttarashadha, Sravana and Uttarabhadra, on a
Thursday forms what is known as Rajayoga and this is considered
very fortunate for starting the construction of a house.

<p> Digging Wells. - The object of sinking a well is to get a
perpetual supply of clean and healthy drinking water.
Varahamihira deals exclusively with the topic of divining the
presence of water by reference to the growth of certain types of
vegetation. The water falling from the clouds is soaked into the
earth and according to internal conditions, runs into different
channels. These channels of water are what are called
under-currents. The type of vegetation present in the soil is
said to give a clue to the distance of these under-currents from
the ground level. For instance, Varahamihira says that if one
sees a Vetasa (Calamus viminalis) plant in a waterless tract,
one can find water by digging the ground at a distance of 3
cubits to the west of it, half a purusa (about 3 1/2, feet)
below the earth. These can be easily tested by our
water-diviners before condemning them as antiquated or
superstitious. Soil conditions are influenced by climatic
factors which in their turn have reference to planetary
radiations. Therefore when wells are dug under favourable
planetary conditions, a plentiful supply of water is expected
without much expense.

<p> Revati, Uttarabhadra, Hasta, Anuradha, Makha, Sravana, Rohini
and Pushyami are favourable for digging wells. The rising sign
should be Pisces, Cancer or Capricorn. Aquarius and Taurus will
not give a good supply of water. Venus and the Moon should be in
kepdras. If the digging operation is begun in the sign occupied
by the Sun, delay will be caused on account of the presence of
hard-rock. An abundant supply of sweet water is indicated when
the Moon or Venus is in a quadrant identical with a full watery
sign. Venus and Moon are watery planets, while Cancer, Capricorn
and Pisces (full) are watery signs.

<p> Entering a New House. - If the house, which one has built, is
calculated to give happiness to the family, one must take proper
astrological counsel in entering it under a propitious moment.
Soon after the eventful day - the day on which one's house is
first occupied - if per chance something untoward happens, he
will not only be heckled sarcastically by the family members,
but his; pride of possession disappears and he feels life not
worth living though his sense of vanity would not allow him to
own his short-sightedness.

<p> Entering new houses will be a matter of great importance as the
results produced by the local magnetic and electrical currents
at the time of the entry of the family into it, may leave upon
its members very far-reaching influences for good or bad. There
is no mythology or superstition here. All human actions are
productive of electrical currents.

<p> "Vastu refers to the form of construction of the house, and the
energies or forces called into existence by the arrangements
made and the materials used in the construction. The subtle
chemical results, effected by the conjunction of various
materials, though not seen by the naked, eye, are still there
and any evil tendencies they may have, to produce danger,
disease, or death to the occupants, must be very sensibly and
dexterously neutralised or counteracted. Therefore the
astrological works lay down certain principles and they are
explained in the Mantra Shastra, where the processes by which
those evil influences are averted are detailed at great
length."*

<hr>
<p>* The Astrological Mirror by Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao.
<hr>

<p> New houses should be entered when the Sun is in Uttarayana,
and when Jupiter and Venus are strongly disposed, after
necessary worships and Bhootabali.

<p> "Then term Bhootas is generally applied to represent the
influences of the earth, fire, water. Sky and air and the
various compounds called into existence by their union. When
special classes of materials and life beings - including men and
cattle - were absent from a particular plot or piece of ground
the influences of the Bhootas (forces or energies) were
naturally working in their own inscrutable ways.

<p> "But the advent of new forms of energies or forces will
certainly have their own influences and if the first set of
Maha-Bhootas are found to be inimicable to the second set of
forces, which are brought upon them for safety and prosperity,
it becomes the duty of intelligent beings like men, to study the
first set of physical and spiritual energies which had their
permanent abode in them, so that the second set may not suffer
from the "frowns" of the first set, and thus, have the very same
objects defeated for gaining which men spent so much money, time
and mental labour. Bhootabali therefore will be the special
sacrifices which are enjoined upon men to offer to the Bhootas
(forces) in the new house before they enter into the same and
seek safety under its roof."

<p> The lunar months of Vaisakha, Jyeshta, Magha and Phalguna are
the best while Kartika and Margasira are neutral or middling.
The most auspicious lunar days are the first of the dark
fortnight, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th and 13th of the
bright half.

<p> Rohini, Mrigasira, Uttarashada, Chitta and Uttarabhadra are the
best constellations. Anuradha and Revati are also permissible.
The other constellations should be rejected.

<p> Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious. Saturday
is also recommended by some Muhurtha writers, but there is risk
of frequent thefts.

<p> The Lagna or the ascendant should be a fixed sign. Common
signs are ordinary white movable signs should be generally
avoided. Provided, however, the Navamsa Lagna is Taurus, a
movable sign may be selected. The 8th house from the Lagna
should be vacant.

<p> Malefics should be disposed in Upachayas, benefics should
fortify quadrants, the Moon must be strongly disposed and the
rising sign should preferably be owned by Jupiter or Venus. When
entry into a new house is effected under such a combination,
prosperity and long fife are said to be conferred on the person
concerned. Griha Pravesam. done in one's own Janma Rasi. Janma
Nakshatra or Janma Lagna, will produce highly beneficial results

<p> Griha Pravesam should not be done when the wife is in advanced
pregnancy (above 6 months).

<p> Buying Lands for Buildings. - The best asterisms for buying a
land are Aswini, Rohini, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Uttara,
Hasta, Swati, Anuradha, Uttarashadha, Sravana, Dharushta,
Satabhisha and Uttarabhadra. Riktha tithis must be scrupulously
avoided. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday are good.

<p> It would be better if the lord of the weekday concerned
occupies the Lagna at the time of the transaction. Some ancient
astrological works recommend Tuesday also as suitable. But in
our humble view, Tuesday should be rejected.

<p> At the time of making the final negotiations, let preferably a
fixed sign rise and let Jupiter occupy a kendra or trikona. Mars
should be placed in the 11th house and he should not be in
Lagna. The lords of Lagna and the 7th should be harmoniously
disposed. Avoid the 11th lord in the 12th.

<p> The land can be taken possession of when the Lagna and Navamsa
are occupied by the Sun and Ketu. When these planets are
together in Lagna or Navamsa, the land is supposed to remain
with the purchaser, permanently.

<p> Buying Houses. - As usual Nanda* thithis ate favourable. New
and old houses can be purchased on Thurs- days and Fridays. The
auspicious constellations are Mrigasira, Aslesha, Makha, Pubba,
Visakha, Moota, Punarvasu and Revati. Taurus, Gemini, Leo,
Libra and Scorpio are the best signs. Malefics should be avoided
in the 7th house, as they may cause trouble and annoyance. Mars
should not be in Lagna.

<hr>
<p>* See appendix for explanation.
<hr>


<p> Repairing Houses. - Do not commence repairs on Tuesdays. Friday
at a moment when Lagna is Taurus or Libra and Monday when Cancer
is rising are very suitable for beginning repairs. The Lagna
must be occupied by a benefic and the Moon should be in an
aquatic sign. Monday, Wednesday and Thursday are the best.

<p> Walls can be whitewashed on Monday, Wednesday. Thursday and
Friday. As usual, inauspicious lunar days and fiery,
constellations should be avoided.

<p> No repairs should be started under the constellations of
Krittika, Makha. Pushyami, Pubba, Hasta, Moola and Revati when
Mars is transiting these constellations.

<p> The most ideal combination either for laying the foundation or
for entering houses or for buying and selling property is a
Thursday identical with the presence of Jupiter in the following
constellations:

<p> Rohini, Mrigasira, Aslesha, Uttara, Poorvashadha, Uttarashadha,
Sravana and Uttarabhadra.

<p> Dismantling Buildings. - When you want to pull down a house,
see that it is done on a day ruled by a fiery constellation
preferably when the rising sign is movable. Then the Moon should
be waning. Mars should be in an Upachaya. Avoid Thursdays, and
the 8th, 9th and 30th lunar days.

<p> Removing to Another House. - This can be done when the usual
Tarabala and Chandrabala are present, one's birth constellation
would be propitious. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are
favourable. Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday should be rejected as
also Riktha tithis or negative lunar days. If the house is taken
for a purpose other than residential, then strengthen the Bhava
or house denoting the purpose. Thus if the house is taken for
investment purposes, see that the 11th house is strongly
disposed. In any case an auspicious lunar day, a favourable
constellation and a good weekday are very necessary so that the
object in view may be gained.


<h2><a name=13>CHAPTER XIII<br>
Agriculture and Farming</a></h2>

<p> The influence of planets on vegetation is an admitted fact.
Frequent references appear in the writings of ancients and their
knowledge gathered from observation and intuition is of
inestimable value-to us. It may be, the ancients realised that
all manifestations of energy on earth of which we have knowledge
are but the emanations ot the cosmic rays. In fact according to
Georges Lakhovsky "the concentration of matter and the
appearance of life, both animate and inanimate, are but
manifestation of these rays". Evidently the electro-magnetic
forces radiated by tire different planetary and stellar bodies
have an intimate bearing on the origin and development of
vegetable life. Solomon wrote: "There is a time to plant and a
time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill and a
time to heal". This is a sound astrological maxim.

<p> Minerals, vegetables and animals form the worldly phenomena and
this is admitted even by the most orthodox scientist. The
interdependence of these three upon one another is too well
known to need any elaboration. Behind these three grand
kingdoms of nature, are the agencies sent out by the solar
globe. Under the solar agencies of sunlight, heat, sound,
magnetism, electricity and other invisible agencies which are
not yet discovered by the modern scientist but which were known
to the ancient Maharishis, minerals grow, expand and crumble
down. In their various states these minerals help the
construction, growth, expansion and destruction of vegetables.
Life pervades throughout the whole universe in some form or
other, and all phenomena have life in them. Life as we conceive
in men may be different from that found among the numberless
animals, and then again among the countless varieties in the
vegetable kingdom. Vegetables are produced by the minerals. Life
functions are exhibited by all vegetation and every student of
botany knows perfectly well that similarities exist between
vegetable and animal functions-physiological, embryological,
etc. Pushing on our natural law and analogy further the life
having vegetables cannot be the products of Lifeless minerals.
If evolution is a principle and theory recognised by experience
then the life in the minerals will be in a particular stage, and
with its environments and working under the great solar agencies
of light, heat, sound, etc., it develops itself into a stage
where it will be fitted to enter into the higher forms of
existence among the various species of vegetables. Among the
Ayurvedic texts, all the metals are said to have life and in
converting them into powders (Bhasmas) there are great santhis
or remedies prescribed which are considered to be effective in
removing the sin which a doctor gets by killing and burning a
Loha or metal. Thus it is clear that minerals beget vegetables
and both are the product of solar energies manifesting
themselves in a particular form. Spectrum analysis of light
reveals that ultra-violet and infra-red rays mark the two ends
of the spectral band. If a particular culture of bacteria is
brought near the spectrum band, then such bacteria are found to
collect near the red rays suggesting that the bacteria have a
greater affinity towards the red rays. Similarly each kind of
vegetable has an attraction for a particular type of planetary
rays.

<p> There is a direct and tangible connection between the planets
and the vegetables. Constellations are bundles of
electro-magnetic forces and their influences on crops are an
admitted fact. Crops of various descriptions should be sown and
reaped in certain constellations.

<p> Cato (234-149 B.C.) gives us full assurance that "timber is
felled most advantageously when the Moon is in conjuction with
the Sun" and that "fig, apple, olive, and pen trees, as well as
vines, should be planted in the dark of the Moon in the
afternoon when there is no south wind blowing".

<p> Plutarch (46-120 A.D.), in his commentary on Hesiod, asserts
that the onion plant grows green and throws forth shoots during
the waning Moon and dries up when the Moon is increasing.

<p> The famous French Astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842-1925)
testifies as follows: "Cucumbers increase at Full Moon, as well
as radishes, turnips, leeks, lilies, horse radish, saffron".
Herbs gathered while the Moon increases are of great efficacy.
Varahamihira, the great astronomer and astrologer of the 1st
century B.C., has made a very good study of vegetable astrology,
and his observations deserve our careful attention.

<p> Before dealing with the various Muhurthas for sowing seeds,
grafting, planting, etc., I may casually refer to certain
combinations of planets which denote, in ft general manner, the
nature of the different crops in the comming seasons.

<p> If at the time when the Sun enters Scorpio, benefic planets
should occupy the said sign, or the 4th, 7th or 10th from it,
the Greeshma or summer crops will thrive well. The same result
may be predicted, if Jupiter is in Aquarius and the Moon is in
Leo. Summer crops will be good if at the time of Sun's entry
into Scorpio, Venus or Mercury or both should occupy either
Dhanus or Thula. If there are malefic planets on both sides
crops will be injured. If a malefic occupies the 7th house at
the time of Sun's entry into Scorpio, crops will suffer blight.
If such 7th house is aspected by benches, crops will no doubt be
injured but they will not be totally destroyed.

<p> Crops which grow in autumn will strive well or will be
destroyed according as the planetary dispositions are good or
bad at the time of Sun's entry into Taurus.

<p> Buying Land for Agriculture. - Monday, Wednesday and Saturday
are good. Let the Moon be waxing and Mars be in the 4th house.
As usual, avoid the Riktha tithis. The best asterisms are:
Aswini, Rohini, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Pushyami, Uttara, Sravana,
Satabhisha, Uttarabhadra, Vishitikarana may also be avoided. If
due to any unavoidable circumstances, it is not possible to be
present at the land to gain possession at the auspicious moment
selected, then pick up and carry away a handful of earth, from
that land when Cancer is rising and the last pada of Bharani,
Aridra or Visakha is ruling.

<p> Ploughing the Land. - The soil should be tilled on days ruled
by benefic planets. Generally, the sign Leo, or the sign
occupied by the Sun or the constellation governed by him is
favourable. The benefic stars are Rohini, Punarvasu, Pushya,
Uttara, Hasta, Anuradha, Moola, Uttarashadha and Uttarabhadra.

<p> All lunar days except the 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th and 10th and New
Moon days are good. At the time of ploughing, let Taurus,
Gemini, Cancer, Capricorn or Pisces be rising. Avoid Scorpio
and Aquarius, if the rising sign is Mesha, it proves fatal to
the cattle; if it is Scorpio, then crops will be destroyed by
fire. If Aquarius, there is fear from thieves. See that the
Lagna is free from malefic association. It is better that the
bright half of the lunar month is selected.

<p> On the first day start ploughing eastward or northward.

<p> Sowing and Planting. - Any seeds can be sown on a day ruled by
Hasta, Chitta, Swati, Makha, Pushyami, Uttara, Uttarashadha,
Uttarabhadra, Rohini, Revati, Aswini, Moola or Anuradha provided
the lunar day is also propitious. Choose a Lagna, owned by the
planet who is lord of the weekday in question. Beets and carrots
may be sown when the Moon is in Sagittarius. Potatoes and other
underground vegetables should be sown when the rising sign is an
aquatic one. On Thursdays fruit trees may be planted when
Sagittarius and Pisces are rising. Flower seeds and cuttings may
be sown in Taurus and Libra. Ragi, gingelli and all grains of
black colour may be advantageously sown in Capricorn and
Aquarius.

<p> Always choose a Lagna owned by the planet who is lord of the
weekday in question. Tomato maybe planted while the Moon is
waxing and is in the sign of Cancer. Capricorn rising is not
favourable. For the best results the Moon should be waxing and
the rising sign at the time of planting should be Cancer,
Scorpio or Pisces. Generally speaking, seeds planted while the
Lagna is Cancer tend towards abundance and fruitfulness. When
the Lagna is Thula the yield will be smaller and the tendency is
toward larger size in both fruit and flower. Aries: Garlic may
be planted with success. Taurus: Peach, plum. potatoes,
radishes, onion sets and turnips. Gemini: Not favourable for
any planting being a barren sign. Cancer: Beans, cabbage, corn,
cucumber, lettuce, melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, cauliflower,
water-melons, and cereals. Leo: Not good for any planting,
especially bad for underground plants such as potato. Virgo:
Flowering plants. Libra: Wheat, rye, barley, rice and other
field crops. Scorpio: Garlic and onion seeds. Sagittarius:
Pepper and other spring crops and garlic. Capricorn: Potato,
radishes and turnips. Aquarius: All black cereals and grains.
Pisces: Cucumbers, pumpkins, radishes, water-melons and carrots.

<p> All odd lunar days except the 9th are good. All even tithis
except the 2nd and 4th should be avoided.

<p> Seeds of flower plants, and fruit-bearing creepers should be
sown in the asterisms of Mriyusira, Punarvasu, Hasta, Chitta,
Swati, Anuradha and Revati. Solarium indicum grows under
Bharani. Aswini is favourable for betal-nuts. Rohini is good for
trees. Sugarcane grows welt under Punarvasu. All varieties of
grain thrive well under Pushya; Swati and Sravana favour paddy.
Anuradha rules sesamum; Moola is favourable for creepers and
roots and black grain crops thrive well under Satabhisha.

<p> Seedlings of coconuts may be planted in Aquarius. The
following extract is from an ancient work on Muhurtha:

<p> "Paddy should be sown on Sunday when the Sun is in Lagna; seeds
of flower plants (aquatic) should be sown on Thursday when
Jupiter is in Lagna. Seedlings of flower sown on Tuesday when
Mars is in Lagna; Palmyra seedlings should be planted on
Wednesday when Mercury is in Lagna. Seedlings of long-lived
fruit trees should be planted on Thursday when Jupiter is in
Lagna. Seedlings of flower trees should be planted on Friday
when Venus is in Lagna. Seeds of black grains should be sown on
Saturday noon when Saturn is in Lagna. While beginning all
agricultural operations, see that the 8th house is unoccupied".

<p> Grafting and Pruning. - Saturn should be favourably placed
preferably in the 6th or 11th house. Strengthen the Lagna by
placing a benefic in a kendra and by rendering the 8th house
vacant. Avoid Tuesdays and Riktha tithis. In all agricultural
operations, the position of the Moon is very important. See
- hat the Moon is strong and free from affliction by Rahu, Ketu
or Saturn. The Moon should be a benefic.

<p> Felling Trees. - Trees should be cut when the Moon is in the
last quarter so that the wood may be strong, massive and
durable. The Lagna must be a dry sign aspected preferably by a
dry planet.

<p> Reaping the Crop. - Bharani, Rohini, Mrigasira, Aridra,
Pushyami, Makha, Uttara, Hasta, Visakha, Anuradha, Uttarashadha
and Sravana are favourable constellations to start reaping the
crop. Avoid 4th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th and 14th lunar days as
also the New Moon. Taurus, Gemini, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius or
Pisces should be rising.

<p> Harvesting. - This can be commenced in Pisces Lagna on a day
ruled by Bharani; Scorpio on a day ruled by Sravana; Cancer
under Visakha. These pairs form special combinations and promote
prosperity.

<p> In-Gathering of Corn. - After the harvest is over. the produce
has to be gathered in. This can be advantageously done under the
constellations of Bharani, Rohini, Mrigasira, Pubba, Aridra,
Punarvasu, Pushya, Makha, Uttdra, Hasta, Swati, Anuradha, Moola,
Sravana and Revati.

<p> Saturn may be located in the 4th house. All lunar days except
the 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 12th, 14th and New Moon are auspicious.
Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday are good. The Amsas of
Moon, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn are also auspicious. Tuesdays
and Sundays should be avoided. Movable signs must be rejected as
they tend to destroy the grain by pests or decomposing.

<p> Taurus rising on days ruled by Makha and Uttara respectively in
the lunar months of Magha and Phalguna goes under the
distinction of Dhanya Parvatha Yoga. Grain collected under this
combination is supposed to confer happiness and prosperity to
the person concerned.

<p> Buying or Selling Cows. - Buying 6r selling of cows or cattle
can be done under the constellations of Aswini, Punarvasu,
Pushya, Hasta, Swati, Visakha, Jyeshta and Revati. Let
preferably Taurus be rising. Avoid Mars in the 8th house.

<p> Buying or Selling Horses. - Let the Moon and the lord of Lagna
be friendly. Avoid their Dwirdwadasa rotations. It is better
that the transaction is done when Sagittarius is rising. Let the
lagna be an airy sign if you wish to buy a race horse.

<p> Buying Sheep. - Let the Lagna be Aries. Avoid Saturn in the 8th
house. Let Aries or Capricorn be rising at the time of the
transaction.

<p> The Lagna and the 6th house should be strong when buying dogs
or hounds. Birds should be purchased when the Lagna is an airy
sign.

<p> Any animal may be purchased on a Thursday ruled by Pushya When
the Lagna is Aries. No animal should be sold on days ruled by
Krittika, Aridra, Makha, Aslesha, Swati and Anuradha.

<p> Intelligent, use of knowledge concerning planting, harvesting,
breeding, etc., will bring satisfactory results. Disregard of
these astrological principles is no excuse for failure.


<h2><a name=14>CHAPTER XIV<br>
Travel</a></h2>

<p> Human nature varies from the highest genius to the greatest
ignorance. Phenomena occur in nature whether we notice them or
not. Dr. Johnson is said to have observed: "Let observation with
extensive view survey mankind from China to Peru" Observing,
reflective and thoughtful minds notice various phenomena, in
their daily transactions of life which apparently seem to have
no immediate connection with the failures and successes they
meet with. But when carefully analysed it will be found that
there is some sort of correlation between certain invisible
agencies and events on the earth. But the true causes are
intelligible to the ordinary minds. Suppose a man starts on an
errand at an inauspicious time and fails in his mission, the
planets are not to blame. They are only an index of events to
happen. They merely reveal that influences operating when the
man started on his mission were such as to give rise to failure.
That the influence of time is not even or uniform needs no great
explanation.

<p> It must be within the experience of an intelligent man that
solar heat and light differ at different times due to motion of
the Sun. This is demonstrable to the ordinary senses. But there
are invisible influences and agenices which can only be grasped
by higher orders of intelligence. The ancient sages had been
able to recognise these influences and how journeys undertaken
at different times of year, month and day, would produce
different kinds of results.

<p> In the modern times, travel facilities have no doubt been
perfected; and so far as human conceptions go, the traveller is
provided with every possible facility. But because the rules of
astrology are ignored, there have been serious accidents and
appaling loss of life. Man is incessantly subject to the
bombardment of different kinds of forces emanating from planets
and the interstellar spaces. The nature of the force operating
at any given moment depends upon the nature of the disposition
of the different planets at the moment concerned. Hence it can
safely be pointed out that a journey undertaken at a propitious
moment would enable the person to consummate the object in view
and get back safely to his home. Instance of loss of life, loss
of money, and distress and disappointments to the traveller,
because the journey was undertaken when the planetary vibrations
were inharmonious, can be cited ad infinitum.

<p> A man wants to go to a foreign country on urgent business. Here
he must have financial success, good health, and a safe trip. We
shall grant for argument's sake that at the time of starting, he
is hale and healthy, has plenty of money and the travel agents
have arranged for him the best conveyance. Naturally he may
laugh at the idea that he should ever consult a good time for
beginning his trip, when everything else is so very
satisfactory.

<p> The poor man must remember that the world's phenomena, physical
and mental, are correlated and that the links between apparently
two different and widely separated events, though invisible, are
still present in the bargain and one who overlooks the currents
of luck really omits important factors which may do him immense
harm when he is least prepared to meet it. The laws of Nature,
some visible and many invisible, are not controlled by the
latest inventions or discoveries in the physical plane alone.
The late Mr. Stead and 3000 men sailed on a ship that was
constructed on the best scientific principles but an iceberg
destroyed this Titanica with all the unlucky passengers in an
hour or two. Lord Kitchner and his 600 officers were embarked on
a splendid Man of War but at an unlucky hour and the whole crew
were drowned within five minutes. We read in the daily press
about the frequent occurrence of aerial, railway and automobile
accidents resulting in the deaths of hundreds of innocent men,
women and children. Many accidents can be prevented if due
attention is paid to the time-factor. The most enlightened
nations and persons have suffered the greatest calamities by
sheer pride and prejudice and neglect of knowledge recorded by
the intellectual gaints of past generations.

<p> The ancients seem to have made a careful study of the subject
of travel for various purposes and have framed sound
astrological rules for the guidance of humanity. There is a
vast literature extant on this subject. As usual, there has also
been some difference of opinion between some of the standard
texts. I have avoided all that is superficial and have confined
myself to an elucidation of just the essential astrological
principles governing travel or yatra.

<p> Journeys. - The best lunar days are the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th,
10th, 11th and 13th. The 14th lunar day and Full and New Moon
days should be avoided at any cost.

<p> If a journey is undertaken in the following constellations, the
person is supposed to return back early after satisfactorily
completing his work: Mrigasira, Aswini, Pushya, Punarvasu,
Hasta, Anuradha, Sravana, Moola, Dhanishta and Revati. It is
better that the journey is commenced in the 2nd, 3rd or last
quarter of the constellation. The first quarter may be avoided
as far as possible.

<p> No journey should be undertaken on days ruled by Krittika,
Bharani. Aslesha. Visakha, Pubba, Poorvabhadra and Aridra. Of
these, the following nakshatras may be deemed fit for travelling
beyond the spheres of evil influence: - Krittika - 13 ghatis;
Bharani - 7; Makha - 14; Pubba, Poorvashadha and Poorvabhadra -
16; Swati, Aslesha and Visakha - 14. In our humble experience,
it is found that Bharani and Krittika should always be avoided
while the other stars given in this paragraph, journeys can be
undertaken in.

<p> We have to emphasise that Bharani and Krittika should be
invariably rejected.

<p> Do not travel towards the East on Saturday and Monday; towards
South on Thursday; towards West on Sunday and Friday and towards
North on Wednesday and Tuesday. Provided the journey is timed to
begin beyond 22 ghatis on Thursday, 12 ghatis on Tuesday and
Wednesday; 15 ghatis on Friday and Sunday, 8 ghatis on Saturday
and Monday, the above restriction does not hold good. In our
view, Tuesday must preferably be avoided.

<p> Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Leo, Libra and Sagittarius are
favourable signs for starting on a journey.

<p> Rising sign at the time of journey being one's Janma Rasi is
highly favoured. But it should never be the sign of one's Janma
Lagna. Journey should not also be undertaken when the Lagna is
the 5th, 7th or the 9th from one's Janma Lagna.

<p> Let Jupiter or Venus be well placed in Lagna at the time of
starting. This makes the journey successful.

<p> Ancient texts contain several other rules prohibiting journeys
towards different directions when different constellations rule.
There is then the question,of Yogini. Chandra Garbha,
Yatraphani Chakra, etc., a consideration of all of which would
only lead to confusion. It is indeed very difficult to select a
day thoroughly favourable in respect of all factors.

<p> Therefore, readers would do well to restrict the choice of a
day to considerations already set forth above. It must be noted
that strict adherence to the astrological rules is impossible at
times of emergency. Supposing a friend or relative is seriously
ill and he is to be visited. There is no question of finding an
auspicious date and time. The best thing to do is to begin the
journey at the most auspicious hora of the day. If one is to go
on a pilgrimage or on a pleasure trip or on business,
arrangements for Which could be made in advance, a day
conforming to all astrological considerations should be fixed.
The most essential factors to be remembered in selecting a
suitable day for travel are (a) a good lunar day, (b) a
favourable constellation, (c) a well-fortified Lagna and (d) the
absence of Panchaka Dosha. If these are properly observed, that
means alt astrological precautions will have been taken.

<p> The following general combinations would be of utmost
importance to the average person: -

<p> (1) let the Moon be strong and dignified at the time of
starting.

<p> (2) Avoid days of vernal and autumnal equinox and the days on
which the Sun enters a new sign every month.

<p> (3) The Moon should be in the 3rd, 6th, 9th or 12th and Jupiter
in a kendra from Lagna.

<p> (4) Start when the Moon is in Lagna fortified by the
disposition of Jupiter or Venus in a kendra.

<p> (5) Jupiter strong in Lagna and the Moon in any place other
than the 8th would be a strong combination.

<p> (6) The journey will be easy and peaceful if the Moon be in the
7th and Venus and Mercury be in the 4th.

<p> (7) Mercury in the 4th, Jupiter in the 2nd or 7th will
neutralise all the other adverse influences.

<p> (8) Benefics dignified in kendras of trikonas act as powerful
antidotes for all evils.

<p> (9) Jupiter in Lagna, malefics in Upachayas and Venus in any
house other than the 7th would be an ideal combinations.

<p> Short Journeys. - Render the Lagna and the Moon strong. If
these two conditions cannot be fulfilled, start in the hora of
the strongest planet keeping in view the Tarabala and
Chandrabala factors.

<p> Long-distance Journeys. - All the rules given in the earlier
pages of this chapter are to be observed. Let the Moon be
increasing and in a favourable situation so that there might be
no delay or hindrance. Pay special attention to the eighth house
and see that Mars is not there. Choose a day and time in which
the Yatra Lagna agrees with the Janma Rasi. Avoid malefics in
the 7th. If the journey is by car or train, avoid affliction to
Lagna and the 8th lord by Mars and Rahu. If the Lagna is
afflicted by Mars, there will be danger of accidents; if by
Rahu, there will be disappointment and disease.

<p> Pilgrimage. - Follow the rules in the earlier pages of this
chapter. Let Jupiter be in Lagna or the 9th house. Avoid the
months when Jupiter is combust.

<p> Air Journeys. - Take due note of Tarabala. Let the Lagna be an
aerial sign. Avoid Mars in Lagna, the 7th and the 8th. Let the
Moon be waxing and as far away from Rahu as possible. Render the
ascendant strong by a suitable disposition of Jupiter.

<p> Sea Voyage. - Pay special attention to watery signs. Let
preferably Cancer be the Lagna occupied by a watery planet. As
usual, avoid Mars in Lagna, the 7th or 8th house. Venus should
be favourably placed.

<p> Business Journeys. - If you are to meet an influential person,
let the rising sign fall in the 10th house in birth chart. Avoid
malefics in Lagna and the 9th. Mercury is the planet of trade
and business. He should therefore be either in Lagna or in the
10th or 11th but he should not be aspected by a malefic
especially Saturn. Mercury in retrograde is also favourable as
he will hasten the transaction to your satisfaction. Prosperity
and success follow the Moon in good aspect to Mercury. If the
Moon is in 8th or 12th house, the person falls ill on the way.
Hence see that the Moon is in favourable position. See also that
the 2nd lord is not afflicted and that he is favourably
situated. In all these cases, mutual aspects between Mars,
Saturn and Rahu should be invariably avoided as they indicate
hitches and insurmountable obstacles.


<h2><a name=15>CHAPTER XV<br>
Medical Elections</a></h2>

<p> The influences of the planets on human diseases appear with
such persistence in the writings of the ancients that it is
impossible to ignore their testimony in any orderly survey of
the subject. While it is doubtless true that some of these
references rest upon a basis of common superstition only; it is
impossible to deny that many others appear to be founded upon
careful observation and recorded experience.

<p> The tithi and nakshatra, which are so important in Muhurtha,
are based on the luni-solar movements. In the realm of
astrology, the Moon is the sensorium, transmitter and collector
of other planetary influences. In fact, seasonal changes,
climate, electrical storms and our emotional behaviour are
obviously correlated with the phases of the Sun and the Moon.
Crises in acute diseases are marked by the transiting Moon which
is the minute hand on the clock of destiny. The most serious
crisis day in acute diseases is on the 14th day when the Moon is
in opposition to his place when the disease started. When the
Moon occupies certain positions, he disturbs the equalibrium of
the patient's vitality so much so that medicine administered on
such days would not prove efficacious. Hence the need for
electing a proper time for undertaking medical and surgical
treatments.

<p> Medical astrology is a vast science and it is impossible to
treat in this volume all the available information on the
subject. Therefore I am giving such hints as would be absolutely
necessary in the daily life of an average person.

<p> Beginning Treatment. - If one is suffering from a chronic
disease, the treatment should begin under Aswini, Rohini,
Mrigasira. Punarvasu, Pushyami, Uttara, Uttarashadha,
Uttarabhadra, Hasta, Chitta, Swati, Anuradha, Sravana,
Dhanishta, Satabhisha, and Revati. In respect of ordinary
complaints such as fever, biliousness, etc., no treatment would
be necessary unless the person has fallen ill in Pubba,
Poorvashadha, Poorvabhadra, Aslesha, Jyeshta, Aridra and Swati.
Treatment is absolutely necessary when one takes to bed-under
the following combinations, viz.: -

<p> (a} Sunday coinciding with the 4th lunar day ruled by Aridra,
Aslesha or Makha.

<p> (b) Tuesday coinciding with the 9th lunar day ruled by Jyeshta,
Swati, or Bharani, and

<p> (c) Saturday coinciding with the: 14th lunar day ruled by
Pubba, Poorvashadha and. Poorvabhadra.

<p> Similarly, an illness that sets in under one's Janma Nakshatra
or the 3rd, 5th and 7tb therefrom will cause much distress.

<p> In regard to long-standing diseases or recurrent fevers, the
best time for taking medicine is Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday, coinciding with Hasta, Aswini, Chitta and Punarvasu
respectively and especially at the time when the Moon, Mercury,
Jupiter and Venus occupy their own vargas and a moveable Rasi or
Amsa is rising. -

<p> Persons suffering from Typhoid or enteric should begin
treatment on a Sunday coinciding with the 4th, 9th or 14th lunar
day not ruled respectively by Aridra, Bharani and Visakha.

<p> Any treatment commenced under Ugra yogas are supposed to prove
successful. Ugra yogas arise when the 3rd (or 9th), 4th, 5th,
6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 12th (or 3rd) and 13th lunar days coincide
respectively with Rohini, Uttara, Sravana, Mrigasira. Revats,
Krittika, Pushva, Anuradha. Krittika (or Makha).

<p> Treatment for Venereal Disease. - Select a time when Aries or
Cancer is rising on a New Moon day ruled by Kshipram. Ugram and
Chara constellations.

<p> Treatment for Rheumatisms - The 3rd, 8th and 13th lunar days
are good. Select Thursday ruled by Aslesha or Aswini.

<p> Treatment for Gonorrhoea. - Wednesday is the best. Let the
lunar day be the 4th, 9th or 14th ruled by Kshipra, Ugra or
Chara constellations.

<p> Treatment for Leprosy. - The rising sign should be Kumbha,
Makara, Mesha, Simha or Vrischika. Place a powerful malefic in
the 8th house. Select (a) Tuesday coinciding with Mrigasira,
Chitta and Dhanishta, (b) Saturday ruled by Pushya. Anuradha and
Uttarabhadra, and (c) Sunday coinciding with Krittika, Uttara
and Uttarashadha. The lunar day must be the 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th
or the 14th.

<p> Treatment for Epilepsy. - Let the Lagna be a common sign or a
moveable sign occupied by the Sun and the Moon. Fixed signs
should be avoided.

<p> Treatment for Consumption. - The lunar day must be free from
Vishtikarana. The ruling constellation must belong to the
Sadharana group and the Moon must be aspected by a retrograde
planet.

<p> Treatment for Ascites. - Tuesday is the best. The constellation
must be Bharani, Krittika, Aridra, Aslesha, Visakha, Makha or
Jyeshta.

<p> Taking Purgative. - Purgatives may be taken on the 2nd, 6th or
12th lunar day. Any weekday (except Tuesday) may be chosen
provided the ruling constellation be Punarvasu, Revati, Swati or
Aridra. Afternoon must be avoided.

<p> Taking Enemas. - Select either Saturday or Tuesday and avoid
malefic planets in the 7th and 8th houses.

<p> Dental Treatment. - The Ugra yoga above referred to is quite
suitable for dental treatment also. See that the Moon is not
afflicted and that Chandrashtama is also avoided.

<p> Taking Infections. - Injections may be taken on Saturday or
Monday. Aries, Taurus. Cancer and Virgo are auspicious. The 8th
house must be unoccupied. See that Mercury'is free from
affliction; as otherwise the pain wilt be severe and nervous
weakness may set in.

<p> Surgical Operations. - When possible, operate in the period of
the intrease of the Moon. Never operate at the exact time of the
Full Moon as the bodily fluids are running highest then. Let not
the Moon at the time of the operation be in the same sign as at
birth. No Operation should be done on the part of the body ruled
by the sign through which the Moon is transiting at that time
but wait a day or more until the Moon passes into the next sign
below, and especially, if the Moon be in conjunction, or evil
aspect to malefics at the time.

<p> For surgical operations Tuesday or Saturday is recommended.
Mars must be powerful. The 8th house should be unoccupied. And
the ruling constellation is Aridra, Jyeshta. Aslesha or Moola
coinciding with the 4th, 9th or 14th lunar day. It is very
necessary to strengthen the house ruling the part of the body to
be operated upon. This if the stomach is to be operated upon,
the time selected should be such as to render the 5th house
strong by benefic aspects. Mutual aspects between Mars and
Saturn should be avoided.

<p> Treatment for the Nose. - The ascendant must be Cancer, Leo of
Virgo. The Moon must be free from affliction. Avoid Mars or for
that matter any malefic in the 8th. The Sun should be unaspected
by Saturn or Rahu.

<p> To Prepare Medicines. - Preparation of medicines should be
commenced when the Lagna is Chara or Dwiswabhava. Fixed signs
should be invariably rejected. The 6th, 7th and 8th houses
should be unoccupied. Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday are good. Auspicious lunar days are the 1st, 4th, 6th,
8th, 9th, 11th and 14th.

<p> Any panacea prepared when Saturn, Mars and the
Sun are in Lagna or in a kendra from Lagna. is said to
become an effective remedy for all diseases.

<p> Taking First Bath after illness. - When one has completely
recovered from an illness of long duration the first bath should
be given on a day ruled by Aswini, Bharani, Krittika,
Mrigasira, Aridra, Pushya. Pubba, Hasta, Chitta, Visakha, Moola,
Poorvashadha and Poorvabhadra. There must be Tarabala also.
Chandrashtamas should be avoided. Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday are good. The 4th, 8th, 9th, 14th and New Moon days
should be avoided.


<h2><a name=16>CHAPTER XVI<br>
Public Matters</a></h2>

<p> In this chapter is included information on various matters
concerning public welfare. In the light of the present official
attitude towards astrology, this chapter cannot be of much
practical importance. Yet as in several public functions in
India astrological consultations are not altogether 6one away
with but resorted to privately it is hoped that the principles
given below would prove of value to those who are called upon to
fix up suitable time for affairs of momentous importance to the
public.


<p> The astrological precepts on public affairs may be considered
by ill-informed or half educated persons as ridiculous. But one
who is a keen student of natural laws and who knows the
importance of time and its manifestations cannot fail to notice
that there is much sense underlying these precepts, for we are
only asked to move in harmony with laws of nature. An
intelligent man must question himself why, for instance a
project launched at one hour proves fortunate investment, white
another launched at a different hour proves most unluckly. Some
ventures are doomed to failure from their very inception in
spite of all the apparent favourable, circumstances.
Consequently even those who make it a point to scoff at
astrology cannot help speaking such as "illstarred affairs"
although unaware of the meaning of this expression. Many
nation-building activities have either proved abortive or
resulted in failure simply because they were started in an
unlucky moment.

<p> Building and Launching Ships. - The constellations Jyeshta.
Makha, Visakha, Aridra, Rohini, Bharani, Knttika and Aslesha
should be avoided. The remaining ones are auspicious. Sunday,
Thursday and Friday are good. Let the Lagna be a watery sign.
Place the lord of Lagna in the 9th or 11th house. The lord of
Janma Rasi should be in a watery sign. Avoid movable signs. Let
there be no planet in 8th house. In building ships for war,
strengthen the position of Mars; In building merchant and
passenger ships, see that. Mercury is dignified or at least
occupies an Upachaya sign free from affliction. Either Venus or
Jupiter should be in a kendra or trikona. The conjunction of
Mars and Moon and Mars and Lagna or Lagnadhipathi should be
avoided.

<p> Building Towns and Cities. - The foundation stone should be
laid at an auspicious moment as per rules given in the chapter
on House Building. The best asterisms for laying the foundation
for building a town are Aswini, Chitta and Revati. The Lagna
must be a fixed sign powerful ly aspected by Jupiter. This gives
durability and continuance. Place Mercury in an auspicious
position. This makes the city grow into a big trading centre.
Confine Saturn to an Upachaya. Mars should have no connection
with the Lagna. Have the construction begun when the Moon is
increasing in light? Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are
good. Movable signs should be avoided. Benefic planets should be
in Lagna, the 2nd and the 9th houses. Malefics should be in 3rd
and 11th houses. The 8th should be vacant as also the 12th. But
a benefic in the 12th is permissible.

<p> Building Military Quarters. - The constellation of
Uttarabhadra is the best for beginning the construction
of military quarters or barracks.

<p> Dairy Farms. - Let Taurus or Cancer be the rising sign. Aswini,
Punarvasu, Pushya. dasta, Swati, Sravana, Dhanishta and
Satabhisha are the best Nakshatras. The presence of the Moon in
Lagna augurs prosperity. Monday is the best weekday.

<p> Electing Head of the State. - The best constellations
areAswinr. Rohini, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Pushya. Uttara, Hasta,
Anuradha. Uttarashadha, Sravana. Uttarabhadra and Revati. All
odd lunar days (in the bright half) except the 9th are good. The
2nd and 10th lunar days are also favourable. The rising sign
must be Aries. Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius,
Aquarius or Pisces.

<p> Strengthen the Sun and the Moon. Fortify the Lagna and the 10th
and their lords. Let the 8th house be vacant. Confine malefics
to Upachayas. If possible, the Sun and the Moon should be placed
in Cancer or Leo preferably subject to the aspect of Jupiter. As
usual, the Tarabala, Chandrabala, Panchaka, etc., should be
carefully looked into.

<p> Coronation. - The foregoing rules apply to coronation also. If
possible, let Lagna be Leo occupied by the Sun and aspected by
Jupiter. In case of democratic rule, the new Government may
begin at a time when Kumbha is rising with Saturn in Lagna or in
Thula aspected in either case by Jupiter or Venus.

<p> Installing a Deiiy. - Building temples and installing deities
involve the consideration of very important astrological
principies which an average student of astrology will be unable
to understand thoroughly. Therefore, selection of an auspicious
moment for such purposes may well be left to a specialist. There
are complicated astronomical, astrological and religious rules
given in original Works and the reader Will do well to refer to
such works as Brihat Samhits, Kalamrita. etc., for greater
details. Here I shall give just a few salient principles.

<p> The installation of a deity should be done when the Sun is in
the Northern course. The lunar month of Magha should be avoided.
According to Kalaprakasika, the ceremony is to be done when
Jupiter and Venus are dignified and devoid of adverse
influences.

<p> Rohini, Mrigasira. Punarvasu, Pushya, Uttara, Hasta, Swati,
Uttarashadha and Uttarabhadra are good constellations for this
purpose. All odd lunar days (except the 9th) including the 2nd,
6th and 10th are favourable. The Lagna must be a fixed sign. A
common sign may be selected for a female Deity. Movable signs
should always be rejected. The Lagna should not be conjoined by
the luminaries or malefics or otherwise the town concerned will
be destroyed. No malefic should occupy the 7th. There should be
no planet in the 8th. The ceremony should be avoided at the end
of an Ayana, the end of a year, of a lunar day and of an
asterism; and on days on which halos round the Sun and the Moon
are visible.


<h2><a name=17>CHAPTER XVII<br>
Miscellaneous Elections</a></h2>

<p> In the foregoing chapters elections bearing upon almost all
human activities have been clearly described. In this chapter I
propose to deal with a few more important ones bearing upon
sports, law-suits, prisoners and war.

<p> Lotteries and Competitions. - Success in lotteries and
competitions generally depends upon the strength of the birth
horoscope in regard to the house of finance and the nature of
the directional influences at the time concerned. Therefore,
much reliance cannot be placed on the strength of election in.
regard to chance-games.

<p> Aswini, Bharani, Punarvasu, Pushya, Hasta, Chitta, Visakha,
Poorvashadha and Revati are excellent for entering into
competitions. The 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 11th and 13th lunar days
are good. All weekdays are suitable except Tuesday and Saturday.
Let the Lagna belong to a benefic planet. Fortify the Moon and
the 5th and the 9th houses. Avoid the 11th lord in the 12th and
Mars in the 8th. Saturn should cast no aspect either on the 2nd
house or on the 2nd lord.

<p> Horse Races. - Here again the birth chart is important. Horses
are said to be governed by Aswini. This constellation therefore
is fortunate for purchasing and training horse for race
purposes. Krittika, Mrigasira, Punarvasu, Pushya, Uttarabhadra,
Hasta, Swati, Visakha, Anuradha and Dhanishta are also good.
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are favourable. If you
want to run a horse for a race, place Sagittarius in Lagna and
strengthen the 10th house.

<p> Filing Law-suits. - Avoid the usual unfavourable lunar days.
Aswini, Rohini, Mrigasira, Pushya, Uttara, Hasta, Chitta,
Anuradha, Dhanishta and Revati are good. Tuesday and Saturday
should be avoided. Strengthen the Lagna by placing Jupiter in a
Trikona. Let there be no malefic in the 6th house. The lords of
Lagna and the 6th should be as far apart as possible. The Lagna
or at least the Navamsa must be Aries in order to assure success
to the litigation. If benefics occupy kendras or occupying the
male signs, have beneficial aspects, there will be peace between
the parties.

<p> Seeking Escaped Prisoners. - Saturday, Monday and Tuesday are
favourable weekdays. Aswini, Rohini, Aridra, Aslesha, Pubba,
Chitta, Visakha, Moola, Uttarashadha and Revati are auspicious.
The Lagna must be in a movable sign aspected or occupied by
Mercury or Moon. The 6th lord should occupy the 11th and be free
from affliction. See that the Moon does not occupy the 12th in
conjunction with any other planet. Make the Sun weak. If
possible, let Rahu or Ketu be posited in Lagna. Parivarthana or
exchange of house between lords of Lagna and the 7th is also
desirable.

<p> Buying Arms. - The most favourable constellations are
Punarvasu, Pushya, Hasta, Chitta, Rohini, Mrigasira, Visakha,
Anuradha, Jyeshta, Uttara, Uttarashadha, Uttarabhadra, Revati
and Aswini. Avoid Riktha Tithis the 4th. 9th and 14th lunar
days. Sunday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious. Some works
recommend Tuesday also as favourable. A martian sign must be
rising, or culminating and Mars must be in a dignified position.

<p> Starting Wars. - Several standard works on Muhurtha do not
specially mention the constellations, etc., suitable for
starting wars. Planetary combinations for the defeat of the
enemy are given. However, by a reference to relevant literature
on the subject, we have been able to gather the following
information. War must be started on a day ruled by Aswini,
Bharani, Krittika, Aridra, Aslesha, Makha, Pubba, Chitta,
Jyeshta, Satabhisha and Revati. Of the lunar days except the
4th, 9th and 14th the rest are said to be fortunate. Sunday,
Tuesday and Thursday are supposed to ensure victory.

<p> In our humble view if Tuesday is selected Mars must be rendered
strong.

<p> The enemy is said to retreat in confusion if the war is begun
in a Chara Lagna when the Moon occupies a fixed sign. The enemy
is also said to retreat early if the Lagna is Aries, Leo, Taurus
and Sagittarius. There should be no conjunction of or aspect
between Mars and Saturn if great mortality and bloodshed are to
be avoided. Mars should be elevated preferably if the 7th house
or the meridian unaspected by any other malefic. The Lagna must,
as usual, be strong.

<p> Destroying Strongholds. - Let a fiery sign be rising with Mars
posited in or aspecting Lagna. A strong-hold besieged under the
influence of Aries is bound to fall early. Similarly,
Sagittarius ascending with Mars in it would render the collapse
of any stronghold inevitable.

<p> Making Peace. - This is an important item in the lives of
nations. Peace must be under a strong influence of Jupiter. The
ascending sign and amsa must be either Pisces or Taurus or
Virgo. Benefics should be strongly placed. Saturn must be either
in the 12th or in Upachaya. There should be no conjunction
between Mars and Rahu or Mars and Saturn or Rahu and Saturn. The
signatories to the Peace Treaty must themselves have their
horoscopes harmoniously disposed. The constellations of
Mrigasira, Chitta, Dhanishta, Aridra, Swati, Satabhisha,
Anuradha and Uttarabhadra should be avoided, as also the 4th.
7th, 8th, 9th and 12th lunar days and New and Full Moon days.
Peace made under the following combinations is said to last for
a long time: -

<p> (1) The Moon should be in the 10th house, Jupiter in the 4th
and Mars and Saturn in the 11th (Mars and Saturn should not be
in conjunction).

these simple astrological rules and rid the world of perpetual
threat to Peace?

<p> The conceit of modern progress has no more respect for ancient
ideas then for the forgotten civilizations of old, even though
in many essentials they have anticipated or outstripped all that
we boast of.


<h2><a name=18>CHAPTER XVIII<br>
Summary</a></h2>

<p> In the last seventeen chapters, we have been able to cover
almost all the Important aspects of Muhurtha, a branch of
astrology which is still very popular, amongst all sections of
people not only in India but in other parts of the world too.

<p> The rationale of Muhurtha consists in appreciating the
importance of the time-factor in all human undertakings. It is
an admitted fact that all source of life and terrestrial
activities is the Sun. Forces emanating from thit glorious body
vary in intensity and influence as a result of their contact
with other celestial bodies. Man is himself a bundle of
electrical currents and therefore there is always a sort of
interaction between planetary forces and those incessantly
radiated by man. By Muhurtha is meant that valuable moment when
there is the greatest harmony or resonance between human and
stellar radiations.

<p> Horoscopy is diagnostic. Muhurtha is preventive on
prescriptive. It sets at naught the theory of absolute
determinism and gives scope for the display of volition within
reasonable limits. Therefore even if afitictions exist in the
birth horoscope they can be neutralised or at least lessened by
recourse to Muhurtha.

<p> Muhurtha takes into cognizance the importance of the radical
Moon as he indicates the mind and alt our psychological
inhibitions. Hence almost every election is to be so timed as to
have reference to the birth star and consequently to the birth
Moon. Janma Tara is the ruling constellation while Janma Rasi
means the zodiacal sign occupied by the Moon at the time of
one's birth.

<p> In electional astrology, the Panchanga, made up as it is of
five important astrological limbs, is of great significance.
The Panchanga consists of (1) Tithi, (2) Vara, (3) Nakshatra,
(4) Yoga and (5) Karana.

<p> The Tithi is the lunar day. This can be known thus: Subtract
the longitude of the Sun from that of the Moon in degrees at a
given time. Divide the remainder by 12 and the quotient plus one
will be the current tilhi. The remainder when subtracted from 12
and divided by the diurnal motion in degrees will give in day
the time at which the lunar day will change. Vara is of course
the usual weekday commencing from Sunday and ending with
Saturday. The Nakshatra is the ruling constellation. This can
be ascertained thus: - Reduce the position of the "Moon into
minutes and divide it by 800. The quotient represents the past
nakshatra and the remainder ait portion of trie next star. Then
we have the Yoga which may be obtained thus: - Take the position
of the Sun and the Moon and divide it by the sum of their
motions. The quotient as usual represents the past yoga. Then
we have the last limb, viz., Karana or haif a lunar day. There
are 27 Nakshatras, 27 Yogas and 11 Karanas.

<p> In Muhurtha, the pride of place is always given to Nakshatra.
Vara and Tithi. The other two limbs whilst no doubt important in
their own way are in actual practice of secondary value.

<p> In selecting auspicious times, due notice must be taken of the
purpose in view. Each human activity requires the strengthening
of a particular house or signification or the presence of a
particular type of combination.

<p> Rasis and constellations have their negative periods also. Such
periods, should be rejected in all good works. Tuesday and
Saturday are invariably bad for all auspicious works. There are
certain exceptions for this general rule. For instance, Tuesday
is good for surgical operations.

<p> The most important factors to be considered are the Tarabala or
strength of constellation. Chandrabala: or lunar strength and
the Panchaka or the strength of the sum-total of five kinds of
energies called into play at a particular moment. In all these
cases there are exceptions to be noted. Hence, in the election
of a Muhurtha, one should be very careful. Each constellation
has its own role to play as suitable for a certain type of
activity. In fact, Pushyami is considered a constellation par
excellence. It could be employed for all purposes but not for
marriage.

<p> There are twenty-one great evils (Mahadoshas) being the
resultant of the operation of the various forces. As many of
these doshas as possible must be avoided. Of these, Kujashtana
and Bhrigushataka are definitely harmful for marriage while the
others are equally evil in respect of other elections. One
important consideration should weigh with the Astrologer, viz.,
that the force of good must supersede those of evil for an
absolutely good Muhurtha is inconceivable. Several combinations
and exceptions are given which would render the forces of evil
either null and void or less harmful. For instance, do day of
the week is blemished provided the lord thereof is strongly
placed. A benefic exalted in Lagna should nullify all other
adverse influences, if the kendras are fortified, sources of
evil are considerably lessened.

<p> A certain weekday coinciding with a certain lunar day and
constellation constitutes a special Yoga capable of generating
very good influences. For example, Thursday identical with the
4th lunar day and the constellation Makha gives rise to Siddha
Yoga, a highly favourable combination. These special influences
merit the attention of a student of Muhurtha.

<p> Of the Shodasa Karmas (16 kinds of ceremonies) prescribed for
the Hindu, excepting a few, the vest are common to persons of
all castes; creeds and nationalities and they are therefore of
universal application. Nishekam or the first sexual act is
astrologically very significant for *"not only do the radiations
from these stars exercise an influence on the animal and human
embryo but, since all substance, living or inert, is constituted
of elections which are materialised radiations, the formation of
all organic beings on earth depends directly on the influence of
these radiations on the human egg at the moment of conception".

<p> The ancients have also hinted at the possibility of change of
sex by having the ceremony of Pumsavana done when the foetus has
attained a certain age. Of the post-natal ceremonies. Upanayana
is very important. Fixing a suitable time for this ceremony is
indeed highly difficult. This should be left to be done by an
expert until the student has gained sufficient experience which
could enable him to do the work independently.

<p> In regard to marriage, the following suggestions may be
carefully noted: -

<p> (1) Do not begin the comparison of horoscopes without testing
the correctness of the castings submitted.

<p> (2) Examine the longevity of the bridegroom and the bride. If
short life is indicated either for the bride or for the
bridegroom do not recommend the match unless there are
neutralising influences in either of the horoscopes.

<p> (3) The 7th and 8th houses should be carefully examined. When
there are many afflictions, carefully find out if there are
neutralising influences also. Otherwise reject the match.

<p> (4) The first condition is the inherent strength of the
horoscope. Next in importance comes the question of examining
marriage adaptability.

<p> (5) A girl belonging to Rakshasa Gana should not be married to
a boy belonging to Manusha of Deva Gana. The reverse condition
is recommended.

<p> (6) In examining Graha Maitra which is the sins qua non of
marriage stability, consideration should be had not only to the
Janma Rasis of the couple but to the Janma Navamsa also. When
Graha Maitra does not exist according to Janma Rasi, then the
latter must be considered. Under certain conditions (p. 91) even
want of Graha Maitra can be ignored. All these have to be
carefully looked into before pronouncing an opinion. The common
Janma Nakshatra factor presents many difficulties for a beginner
in astrology. The subtle distinctions bearing on this
consideration should be carefully grasped. Then there is, the
question of Ku]a Dosha about which much fuss is being made in
this part of India. No horoscope should be rejected unless it
has been examined from all astrological angles.

<p> (7) If the girl and the boy have their 5th houses considerably
afflicted, then marriage between them Is not desirable. But much
of the evil due to these radical dispositions can be ovecome by
selecting a proper Muhurtha.

<p> (8) *"In the beginning of your literary attempts in the
astrological field do not be-over-confident or hasty in having
properly understood the principles explained here. Refer your
knowledge to some gentlemen who have much experience in these
matters and whose opinions you ought to value and compare with
your inferences and personal experiences".

<hr>
<p>* The Astrological Mirror by Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao

<p> (9) In marriages, there should be no three or more Jyeshtas.
The eldest son or daughter is called a Jyeshta. There is the
lunar month of Jyeshta and the constellation of Jyeshta.
Therefore the marriage of an eldest son or daughter should not
be done in the constellation of Jyeshta and the lunar month of
Jyeshta. Similarly if the bride and bridegroom happen to be
Jyeshtas the marriage should not be celebrated either in the
month of Jyeshta or in the constellation of Jyeshta.

<p> (10) In fixing a Muhurtha for marriage, keep the 7th house
clean, and 6th and 8th unoccupied by Venus and Mars
respectively. Jupiter's presence in a kendra or trikona is very
desirable.

<p> (11) When birth data are not available. take the Nama Nakshatra
(see Appendix) of the couple. The name of an individual's made
up of letters or aksharas, by which is meant indestructible
forms of sound vibrations, and when you consider a name, you are
only measuring the energy content of the individual.

<p> (12) Parents waste huge sums on Marriage Shows such as dinners,
music, jewels and pandals but they are niggardly in paying
proper remuneration to a deserving astrologer who could fix up a
really auspicious moment. It astrological consultation is not
to be a matter of formality but of serious importance, then the
learned astrologer should be paid properly. A proper Muhurtha
will ensure the future of the couple and anything expended
towards this item is well spent. If without caring to consult an
expert astrologer, the marriage is done and it proves a failure,
then all the energy and finance spent would be a sheer waste.
Hence it is very necessary that an expert astrologer is pressed
into service.

<p> General elections given in Chapter XIV comprehend very
important human activity and as far as possible due attention
must be paid to the astrological factors either in regard to
going on a,journey or starting a business or for doing any
important work. Auspicious times for day-to-day activities can
be fixed by any amateur astrologer.

<p> Astrology, in relation to house building is a very important
subject, as it takes into account factors which the architect
and the engineer generally ignore. Materials assembled for the
construction of a building radiate different kinds of energies
some good, some indifferent and some definitely harmful. Force
of evil accruing from such sources can be tapped off by laying
the foundation-stone and entering the new house at propitious
moments. An amateur astrologer should not rake the
responsibility of doing this job as it pre-supposes very
intimate knowledge of Vastu Sastra.

<p> In the matter of Travel or Yatra, Krittika, Bharani and the
lunar days of Ashtami and Navami should be invariably avoided.
Journeys are also prohibited towards different directions on
different weekdays. There are exceptions for such rules in cases
of emergency. In selecting a suitable day for travel, a good
lunar day, a favourable constellation and a well-fortified Lagna
merit one's foremost attention. For short journeys existence of
Tarabala is enough. For going on pilgrimages or important
errands, a very suitable day has to be fixed by taking due note
of all the important astrological factors.

<p> The medical elections are intended to ensure speedy recovery
from illness. There is a striking correspondence between the
lunar movements and crises in certain types of disease and this
gives a clue as to why a suitable time should be secured to
commence treatment for long-standing diseases and surgical
operations. Generally Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
coinciding with Hasta, Aswini. China and Punarvasu respectively
would be highly favourable to begin treatment for recurrent
fevers and chronic diseases. The time becomes specially
propilious if in addition to the above the Moon, Mercury,
Jupiter and Venus occupy their own vargas and a movable Rasi is
ascending in Amsa.

<p> Elections bearing on public matters are of dubious value in
view of the current prejudicial official attitude entertained
towards astrology. Vet, as in actual practice, astrologers are
being consulted in private for official purposes, the rules
bearing on elections pertaining to public affairs are bound to
be of some value. It is hoped the day is not far off when
astrology is given its due by the State and recognised as the
science par excellence for the solution of national and
international problems. This expectation on our part may induce
a derisive laugh from "men of sobriety" whose habit of thinking
is confined to a limited horizon. But we are bold enough to say
that astrology when properly pressed into the service of the
State would be far more useful in preventing national and
international complications than all the paraphernalia now
employed by the civilised Governments all over the world.

<h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>

<p> Muhurtha is not the penance for all the ills afflicting a
horoscope. Muhurtha or an auspicious moment can neutralise to a
certain extent the afflictions existing in a birth chart as
affecting the various events.

<p> If marital harmony is completely absent in a birth chart,
Muhurtha cannot confer on the native marital harmony. It reduces
the sources of friction to a certain extent.

<p> Of the different limbs of the panchanga, viz., tithi, vara,
nakshatra, yoga and karana, the nakshatra is very important. If
suppose for a marriage, the tithi is the 6th and the nakshatra
is Sadhana, then the day can be selected. This is the view of
sage Brihaspati and hence acceptable to the other sages. But
even if other factors such as tithi, nakshatra. etc., are
defective, a strong Lagna can neutralise such defects. This is
the view of Narada and we concur with this view. But recourse
should be had to this contingency only under special
circumstances, e.g., when a Muhurtha is to be fixed, say for
accommodating a bridegroom coming from a foreign country, who
has to get back quickly.

<p> According to Roua, Jupiter should be rendered strong for
marriage; Venus for travel; Mercury for learning; Mars for war,
fighting; the Sun for meeting with the rulers, government
officers, etc., and the Moon in respect of all elections.

<p> Abhijin Muhurtha (midday) could be fixed for all elections, in
case a really auspicious time is not available. Add half
duration of the day to sunrise and the Abhijin Muhurtha is
obtained. Suppose sunrise is at 6-10 a.m. (IST) and sunset 6-45
p.m. The interval is 12 hours 30 minutes. Half this, viz., 6
hours 15 minutes added to time of sunrise, viz., 6-10 (1ST)
gives the Abhijin Muhurtha as 6 hours 10 minutes + 6 hours 15
minutes = 12 hours 25 minutes.

<p> According to Sage Bharadwaja a fully flawless Muhurtha is
unthinkable for years. Therefore, fix up an auspicious time,
with less doshas and more gunas. Even sage Narada says:
Avoiding heavy afflictions (mahadoshas), and considering the
ordinary gunas and doshas, fix an auspicious time with more
gunas. That moment proves auspicious.

<p> And always see that Jupiter or Venus is in conjunction with the
ascendant or at least in a kendra or the trine so that all
doshas are rendered infructuous.

<p> The sages appear to have taken a very liberal view of things
especially in regard to marriage. For instance they say that if
the boy and the girl like each other in their first meeting,
that should also receive first consideration - (...) And when
doubts arise between views of different astrologers about the
agreement of horoscopes, we are asked to have recourse to
nimitta (omens) and clinch the issue.

<p> The outstanding exponent of astrology in 20th century was my
revered grandfather the late Prof. B. Suryanarain Rao, a great
historian, savant, linguist and philosopher. Prof. Rao
successfufly defended astrology against the attacks of
ill-informed critlcs most of whom belonged to the so-called
"educated" classes. I conclude this work with the following
extract from the late Professor's The Astrological Mirror:

<p> "To despise to hold a bright lamp in the darkness indicates
stupidity, while to try to secure it at any cost and hold the
same to shed light on our future path really shows consummate
wisdom. Choose your own lot as you please, and either control
the planets and stand a victor in the struggle for existence and
comfort or yield to their evil influences without personal
exertions on your part and be a miserable coward."
